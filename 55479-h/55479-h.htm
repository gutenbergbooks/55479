<p class='line0' style='text-align:left;margin-left:2em;'>Minister of Marine and Fisheries.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—I have the honour to submit herewith my report on the
expedition to Hudson Bay and northward thereof, in the
steamship <span class='it'>Neptune</span>; to which, on your kind recommendation,
I was appointed officer in charge by a commission authorized
under an order in council of August 13, 1903.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Permit me to here acknowledge the kindly and valuable
assistance afforded me by Colonel F. Gourdeau, Deputy Minister
of the Department of Marine and Fisheries, by Commander
G. O. V. Spain, and by all the officers of the department at
Ottawa and Halifax, with whom it was my duty and privilege
to work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The greater part of the credit for the complete and successful
accomplishment of all the instructions for the voyage is due to
Captain S. W. Bartlett, the officers and the crew of the
<span class='it'>Neptune</span>. Their prompt and cheerful attention to orders and
their willing co-operation in all matters relating to the expedition
deserve the highest praise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have great pleasure in calling attention to the valuable
work of the scientific staff of the expedition. Dr. L. E. Borden,
by his skill and attention, kept everybody in a good general
state of health, and in addition rendered great assistance in the
collection of specimens and data relating to ethnology, botany
and zoology. Mr. Andrew Halkett, Naturalist of the Department
of Marine and Fisheries, was indefatigable in the work
of collecting specimens in all branches of natural history. Mr.
C. F. King, who was attached from the staff of the Geological
Survey, took charge in an able manner of the topographical
work, and was willingly assisted by Messrs. Caldwell and Ross
and by the officers of the ship.
<span class='pageno' title='viii' id='Page_viii'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the preparation of this report, I have received much valuable
assistance from Dr. Robert Bell, Acting Director of the
Geological Survey, who has not only helped personally, but
who also kindly allowed the very necessary assistance of the
following members of the staff of that department: Mr. J. M.
Macoun, who named and described the plants in the collections
brought home; Mr. L. Lambe and Dr. H. M. Ami, who

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>VOYAGE TO THE BAY</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The present report contains a narrative of the voyage of the
D.G.S. <span class='it'>Neptune</span>, during the seasons 1903-04, to the northern
parts of Hudson bay, and to the northeastern Arctic islands.
Following this, under their respective headings, are a short
historical account of earlier explorations and discoveries in
northeastern Arctic America; a geographical sketch, together
with summaries of what is at present known of the inhabitants
and geology of the unorganized northeastern territories of the
Dominion; short descriptions of the important whaling and
sealing industries; and opinions as to the possible navigation
of Hudson strait and Hudson bay.
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The appendices contain the meteorological observations
taken on the voyage, interesting notes on the thickness and
growth of the ice; also lists of the birds, plants and fossils collected
in these northern regions. All the collections, except
that of the marine invertebrates, have been fully determined.
The amount of new material in the latter required greater time
for study than could be given before the publication of this
report, and the results will be included in a future publication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This report is based largely upon the knowledge obtained,
during the voyage, by the scientific staff of the expedition;
this has been freely supplemented by information taken from
the reports of previous northern explorations. For the convenience
of the reader, constant references are not made to
these authorities in the text, a list of them being given in an
appendix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Special mention is here made of the indebtedness of the
author to the valuable information contained in the works of
Richardson, McClintock, Dawson, Bell and Sverdrup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The accompanying map has been compiled by Mr. C. Frank
King. It contains all the corrections to coastline made from
his surveys. The ship’s track marked on the map will be found
convenient in following the text of the narrative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All bearings mentioned in the text refer to the true North, on
account of the confusion arising from the great change in the
variation of the compass at different localities included in the
area covered by the report. For example, at Chesterfield inlet
the compass points true North; while at Beechey island, in
Lancaster sound, the variation amounts to 160 degrees, so that
the north end of the needle points south-southwest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The illustrations in the text of the report are from photographs
taken by the author.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Acknowledgment is made of the kindness of Admiral Sir
Arch. L. Douglas for his willing assistance in fitting out the
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
<span class='it'>Neptune</span> at Halifax, where suitable Welsh coal and a fine steam
launch, on his recommendation, were supplied by the
Admiralty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Captain George Comer, of the American whaler <span class='it'>Era</span>,
special thanks are due for his uniform kindness and courtesy
during our long winter together, and for the valuable assistance
rendered, by advice, information and services, to the expedition
and to myself, personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The writer gratefully acknowledges a large amount of
interesting details relating to the natives, whaling industry,
geography and natural history obtained from the Rev. Mr.
Peck, and from the Scottish whaling Captains Milne, Adams,
Guy and Murray.</p>

<h2>PRELIMINARIES TO AND PREPARATIONS FOR THE VOYAGE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Dominion government, in the spring of 1903, decided
to send a cruiser to patrol the waters of Hudson bay and those
adjacent to the eastern Arctic islands; also to aid in the establishment,
on the adjoining shores, of permanent stations for
the collection of customs, the administration of justice and the
enforcement of the law as in other parts of the Dominion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To perform these last duties, Major J. D. Moodie, of the
Northwest Mounted Police, was appointed Acting Commissioner
of the unorganized Northeastern Territories. Under his
command were placed a non-commissioned officer and four constables
of the Northwest Mounted Police, as a nucleus of the
force that in the future would reside at these stations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Neptune</span>, the largest and most powerful ship of the
Newfoundland sealing fleet, was chartered as the most suitable
vessel for the cruiser work. The <span class='it'>Neptune</span> is a stout wooden
ship, built entirely of British oak, sheathed with ‘iron-bark’
and greenheart. Although built in 1873, she is quite sound
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
throughout, and of amazing strength. Her sides are formed
of an outer sheathing of four inches of greenheart, on top of
four inches of oak, covering heavy oak timbers, with an inside
lining of three inches; the space between the inner and outer
skins and the timbers is solidly filled with rock-salt, so that the
sides of the ship are practically eighteen inches thick in all
parts where a contact with the ice is expected. The bow is
further reinforced by a heavy sheathing of iron plates, and
inside it is backed with deadwood, giving it a thickness of eight
feet. The <span class='it'>Neptune</span> is of 465 tons net register, and has engines
of 110 nominal horse-power. This means that the ship
will carry about 800 tons of coal and cargo, and that her
engines will develop about 550 indicated horse-power; sufficient
to drive the loaded ship at the rate of eight knots an hour.
The engines, unlike most of the whaling and sealing ships, are
placed amidships, while the vessel is rigged as a three-masted
schooner, with low masts and little sail power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in June, 1903, I had the honour to be appointed, by
the Honourable Mr. Préfontaine, the Minister of Marine and
Fisheries, to the command of the expedition to Hudson bay and
northwards, on board the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>. I received instructions to
proceed immediately to Halifax, to make necessary alterations
to the ship, and to purchase all the provisions and outfit
required for a two-years’ voyage in the Arctics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship—which only had accommodation for a small
crew—was in the same state in which she had returned from
the spring sealing voyage. After a thorough cleaning, carpenters
and machinists were put aboard, and the work of alteration
rushed day and night. A bridge-deck, covering the boiler and
engine, was erected, with a small chart-house upon it. Alterations
were made to the after cabin, and a new saloon and
staterooms, for the use of the scientific staff, were made
between-decks, forward of the main hatch. The remainder of
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
the between-decks forward was converted into storerooms and
sleeping quarters for the petty officers and the Mounted Police
detachment. The upper forecastle was fitted up for the crew
and firemen. All the sleeping quarters were arranged so that
a small air space separated the sides of the ship from the
berths, and all ironwork was covered with wood. The value of
these preparations was appreciated during the ensuing winter,
when no frozen moisture was found in any part of the ship so
treated, while elsewhere the bare sides had a thick coating of
frost.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>‘Neptune’ and ‘Era,’ Fullerton Harbour.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>All these additions and alterations were made in a month’s
time, during which the stores and provisions were purchased
and delivered on board, together with materials for the stations
on shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The preparations being completed, the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> hauled out
from the dock and anchored in the harbour on the evening of
the 22nd of August.</p>

<h2>THE CRUISE TO WINTER QUARTERS IN HUDSON BAY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>All hands were busy during the morning of the 23rd of
August, in securing the heavy deck-load, consisting of lumber
for the stations, which was piled high on the afterdeck, and
on both sides of the bridge. Oil barrels and tins completely
covered the quarterdeck, while potatoes and other vegetables
were stowed in all corners, even the rigging having its load of
fresh meat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At noon the anchor was lifted, and we steamed out of the
harbour of Halifax, not to return until the middle of October
of the following year. A favouring breeze helped the ship
along, and in the evening we were well on our way eastward
along the southern coast of Nova Scotia. The following evening
the eastern end of Cape Breton was passed, and we stood
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
northward to cross Cabot strait to Newfoundland. A strong
breeze from the northwest sprang up in the night, when, owing
to our heavy deck-load, the ship had to take shelter under St.
Paul island, where we remained until the morning of the 26th.
Fine weather favoured the passage across the gulf, and through
the Strait of Belle Isle. Our first stop on the Labrador coast
was made at Dominoe, where it was expected that a supply of
codfish would be obtained. Unfortunately the season was very
backward, and no dry fish had yet been made on the coast; a
few pairs of sealskin boots were, however, obtained there. Continuing,
with fine weather, northward along this grandly
picturesque coast, Nachvak bay was reached on the 31st.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our interpreter was supposed to reside here, but on reaching
the small Hudson’s Bay post, it was found that he was at
Port Burwell, at the mouth of Hudson strait. More sealskin
boots and a couple of barrels of trout were purchased from the
agent; then, as our tanks were low, we steamed some ten miles
to the head of the bay, to a small river of excellent water. The
scenery about the bay is very grand; cliffs of 3,000 feet present
their rugged barren faces on both sides, rising directly from
the water and terminating skywards in lofty mountains with
sharp peaks. Large patches of snow fill the upper valleys,
where they accentuate the rocky desolation of the peaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another clear, calm day brought us to Port Burwell, a few
miles inside Cape Chidley, the northern point of the Atlantic
coast, where the division line is drawn between the territory
to the eastward, under the jurisdiction of Newfoundland, and
that of the Dominion to the westward. Between Nachvak
and the cape, the mountains of the coast reach their highest
elevations, some of the peaks rising to upwards of 6,000
feet. The outline is extremely rough, the land rises abruptly
from the coast and the scenery is very grand. As Cape Chidley
is approached, the general elevation becomes lower; the land
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
finally sinks into the sea with the Button islands, which form a
group extending some miles beyond the cape. The heavy tides
of Ungava bay exhaust themselves in the passages between the
islands, and, in doing so, cause very dangerous currents. Gray
strait, lying between the cape and the inner islands, would form
an excellent ship canal, if it were not for these strong currents,
which cause a dangerous sea when the tide is running against
the wind, especially when the wind is eastward and the Atlantic
swell heaves into the strait.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/006a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_006' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Crew of the ‘Neptune’ in Winter Costume.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Port Burwell is an excellent harbour, sheltered from all
but the southwest winds, and, even with these, distant capes
break the force of the wind and sea. The harbour lies on the
western side of Gray strait, and about fifteen miles from Cape
Chidley. It was originally discovered by Commander Gordon,
who erected one of the Observation Stations there in 1885.
The surrounding country, although low in comparison with
that to the southward, is rugged, with steep rocky cliffs, that
rise from 100 to 500 feet above the water of the harbour. There
is little level ground in the neighbourhood, and the trading post
established there is situated on a small inside harbour, which
cannot be seen from the anchorage. Trade is carried on with
some dozen families of Eskimos living on the coast, and this is
supplemented by the seals caught by the agent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is probably the most convenient and safest place for
the establishment of a customs station for the regulation of the
shipping trade, entering or leaving Hudson strait, and a small
expenditure for lights would make it a safe port of entry at all
times. The south side of the mouth of Hudson strait, during
the season of ice, is much less embarrassed than the northern
side; as a rule, Port Burwell is free of ice early and late in
the season.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some little trouble occurred in securing the services of Ford
as interpreter, he being under employment at the station; but
the matter was finally satisfactorily arranged with the agent.
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span></p>

<h2>PORT BURWELL TO CUMBERLAND GULF.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the following day the voyage was continued northward
from Port Burwell. A fog came on shortly after we left, and
continued for three days, during which land was only sighted
twice. When the fog partly lifted, on the evening of the 4th,
we found ourselves close to the shore of Cumberland gulf, and
about twenty miles east of Blacklead island. The ship anchored
in one of the many bays of the high rugged islands that fringe
the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A landing was made near the anchorage, and a few hours
spent in climbing over the steep, high hills of gneiss and
granite, which rise from 500 to 1,000 feet above the sea, while
the summits of the hills on the mainland behind often attain
an elevation of 2,000 feet. Almost continuous inland navigation
is afforded by the channels, behind the islands, lying along
the entire southern coast of the gulf. The hills are very rugged,
and show signs of glaciation, though much less marked than
those on the hills of the Labrador coast. The higher valleys are
filled with snow, but there are no real glaciers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather cleared about noon next day, and towards
evening the mission and whaling stations at Blacklead island
were reached. A series of photographs of the place and of its
natives was taken while Major Moodie was explaining the
intentions of the Government to the missionaries and to the
agent of the whaling establishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The settlement consists of a dozen small, one-storied, wooden
buildings, comprising the house and storehouses of the whaling
station, the church, hospital, dwelling house and outbuildings
of the missionaries. All are located at the southeast end of
the island, a few feet above tide water. The surface is
rock, or very moist boulder clay, without drainage, and the
refuse from the native encampment makes the surroundings
very filthy. The water supply is obtained from small ponds,
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span>
in hollows of the rocks on the hill behind the houses. As the
neighbourhood is overrun with dogs, and as the natives often
build their snow houses directly over the ponds, the quality of
the water is very bad, and probably accounts for much of the
sickness prevalent here.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/008a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_008' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Head of Nachvak Bay, Labrador.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The mission is under the charge of the Rev. Mr. Peck, who
for many years has devoted his life to the instruction and
welfare of the Eskimo about Hudson bay, and, of late years, on
Baffin island. He is ably assisted by two younger men, both
of whom have had medical training. The headquarters of the
mission are at Blacklead, from which place the missionaries
travel, several times a year, to Kekerten, on the north side of
the gulf, and to Cape Haven, on Cyrus Field bay, to the south.
In this manner all the natives of the southeastern part of Baffin
island are reached. The work of combating ancient superstitions
has been hard and slow, but the results of the mission are
beginning to tell, and the natives are now taking rapidly to the
teaching and precept of the missionaries. The total number
of Eskimos reached is about five hundred, and they are all
connected with, and depend upon, the whaling stations of
Blacklead, Kekerten and Cape Haven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the summer months all the able-bodied men, with
some of the women and children, proceed to the head of the
bays, and thence far inland, to hunt the barren-ground caribou,
to secure a supply of skins for winter clothing and bedding.
They are absent until September. On their return they are
employed at the whale fishery until the gulf freezes fast,
usually early in December. During the remainder of the
winter, they maintain themselves by harpooning seal through
breathing-holes in the solid ice, or by killing them in the open
water, at the edge of the floe. Whaling is resumed in March
and continues until the ice breaks up; then the seal hunt begins
and ends only when the time arrives to go inland again.
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The whaling operations are carried on in a similar manner
at all of the stations. At each, there are one to three white men
in charge, but the actual work is done by the natives. The
whales are taken by harpooning them from boats cruising among
the broken ice, at the edge of the solid floe. Each station has
from four to six boats; consequently nearly every able-bodied
native is employed in them during the whaling season. They
and their families, at such times, are fed with biscuit, coffee
and molasses from the supplies of the station, but supply their
own animal food. The men are paid irregularly for their work,
usually in tobacco, ammunition and clothing, and they receive
extra pay when a whale is captured. Of course the pay alone
does not at all represent the value of the whale, but the expense
of the station, and the few whales killed prohibit a large expenditure.
On the whole, the whalers may be taken as
beneficial to the Eskimos, and now that the latter have long
been dependent upon the whalers for guns, ammunition and
other articles of civilization, there is no doubt that many would
perish should the whaling stations be closed without other provision
being made for the accustomed supplies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having obtained a pilot at Blacklead, we crossed, the next
morning, to Kekerten, which is situated on one of a group of
small islands forming a harbour a few miles from the mainland
of the north side of the gulf. Owing to the rocks, cargo can
only be landed here at high water; the harbour is open to the
south, so that the anchorage is not safe during the continuation
of winds from that quarter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A three-masted Norwegian schooner was found at anchor,
discharging supplies, and loading the oil, whalebone and skins
taken during the past year. The captain of the schooner and
Mr. Noble, the son of the owner of the station, from Aberdeen,
boarded us shortly after arriving; from Mr. Noble we learned
that two whales had been taken in Cumberland gulf during the
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
past year. The oil and bone from these, together with the oil
and pelts of 3,000 seals, and some bear, wolf, fox and walrus
skins would realize a handsome profit, and lend encouragement
to the continuation of the stations, which, for several years
previous, had not cleared expenses.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/010a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_010' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Port Burwell at Eastern Entrance to Hudson Strait.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Noble informed us that white whales are abundant at
the head of the gulf during the summer, where they frequent
the flat, muddy mouth of a river. They are driven by whaleboats
up the river, on the rising tide, and kept there until the
tide falls, when they become stranded upon the mud flats and
are easily killed. This fishery has only been prosecuted in a
desultory manner, and would probably pay if handled with
judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two rivers on the north side, and one at the head of the
gulf, are famous for their large Arctic trout, or salmon, which
abound in the mouths of these streams during August. There
is no doubt that a profitable fishery could be prosecuted in all
these streams, as well as in many others along the coast to the
northward and southward of Cumberland gulf, but as yet no
attempt has been made to fish them for export.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The station at Kekerten consists of the usual half-dozen
small buildings, all nicely painted, with the whaleboats ranged
on skids, and barrels and tanks alongside clean and ready for
use.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The same evening a return was made to Blacklead, where,
taking on board Captain Jackson, the new master of Cape
Haven station, and his boat’s crew of natives, we left again,
under a brilliant moon, for Cape Haven. The south shore of
the gulf was closely followed, past innumerable bays and narrow
channels formed by the islands and deeply indented shores of
that side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cyrus Field bay was reached late the next afternoon, with a
strong northwesterly breeze. As the approach to Cape Haven is
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
filled with dangerous shoals, it was thought unadvisable to
attempt to enter it so late in the day, and the ship was headed
up the bay, for a harbour known as Frenchman cove. We
arrived at dusk, to find the narrow entrance blocked by a large
iceberg, and the water too deep to anchor outside. A boat was
sent off, and soon returned, reporting a narrow passage between
the ice and rocks; with some danger this was passed, and the
ship anchored safely in the small bay. Two small deserted
houses perched on a narrow ledge of rock, close to the water,
with a number of oil barrels in the rear, represent the remains
of a former small trading station. The diminutive harbour is
surrounded by sharply ragged hills of granite, whose summits
are splotched with patches of snow; the valleys between are
narrow and irregular, and are so thickly strewn with boulders
and broken rock that nearly every trace of soil is hidden. The
scant Arctic vegetation and the deserted houses enhance the
desolation of the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Having taken on board the casks of oil and a supply of fresh
water, the ship was headed for Cape Haven, where a station,
similar to those already described, was found on a snug
harbour, behind a large island, near the end of the cape. This
station belongs to Potter and Wrightington, of Boston, United
States. For several years past it has been unlucky, and the few
whales taken have paid neither the expenses of maintaining the
station nor the cost of supplying it by a special vessel. Natives
sufficient to man four whaleboats live about this station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general aspect of the country about Cyrus Field bay is
somewhat similar to that of Cumberland gulf: high, rugged
hills of gneiss and granite rise from 500 feet to 1,000 feet
above the sea. The land on the northern side of the bay is
lower, and the waters of this portion are broken by low islands
and reefs, many of which become connected at low tide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long chain of islands separates this bay from Frobisher
bay to the southward. These islands are all high and rocky;
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
strong tides rush through the channels between them, and although
several of the channels are reported to be safe for large
ships, they are only used by the natives as short cuts to
Frobisher bay.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Blacklead Island, Cumberland Gulf.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Cape Haven was left late on the afternoon of the 8th, and
Hall island, at the eastern extremity of the chain separating
the bays, was passed in the early evening. The course was then
laid across the mouth of Frobisher bay, to pass to the eastward
of the great island of Resolution, lying on the north side of the
entrance to Hudson strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monumental and Lady Franklin islands lie some twenty
miles off the mouth of Cyrus Field bay, and are about ten miles
apart. A continuous string of large icebergs stretched in a line
between the islands, and continued for some miles beyond them,
both north and south. They showed that the islands were but
the exposed portions of a long dangerous bank, upon which the
bergs had grounded. A similar line of bergs was observed
about ten miles inside and parallel to the outer line. As this
is the only knowledge possessed of these reefs, ships crossing
them should use caution, although, in most places, sufficient
water will probably be found.</p>

<h2>HUDSON STRAIT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The bold, rocky shores of Resolution were passed during the
night and early morning, and during the afternoon we steamed
westward along the southern shores of Baffin island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The channel between Resolution and Baffin islands is some
miles wide, but is obstructed by a number of smaller islands.
Very strong tides rush backwards and forwards through the
channel, rendering dangerous an otherwise good passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The southern shore of Baffin island is indented with many
bays, and no doubt when this coast is surveyed excellent harbours
will be found along it. The land rises rapidly from the
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span>
coast, to an elevation of upwards of 2,500 feet; far inland is
seen the glistening white surface of the great Grinnel glacier,
which flows northward into Frobisher bay. Not being very
active, it does not discharge icebergs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Saddle-back islands were passed in the evening; they
number at least twenty, or double the number laid down on the
chart. There are indications of good harbours between them.
Soundings taken in the vicinity of the supposed Gripper shoal
did not indicate any such obstruction to navigation. A large
number of icebergs were passed during the day, having been
apparently drifted into the strait by the westerly current of its
north side, probably aided by favouring easterly winds. They
were not very numerous to the westward of Big island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The morning of the 10th the ship was off Douglas harbour,
and, from there, coasted along the south side of the strait to
Cape Weggs, whence a passage was taken for the east end of
Charles island. The north side of that island was closely followed,
in order to survey it.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/014a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_014' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Kekerten Harbour, Cumberland Gulf.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Near the western end of the island many walrus were seen
in the water and upon a small islet close to the shore. As
several of these animals were required for dog-food during the
coming winter, the ship was anchored in a small harbour near
by, and early next morning the small launch was lowered ready
for the chase. Soon after leaving the ship, several hundred
walruses were seen sporting in the water about the islet. They
were in bands, varying in numbers from ten to twenty, each
band probably composed of an old male and his harem. A band
would be singled out, and the launch, at full speed would put
after it. When the animals became aware that they were being
chased, they would endeavour to escape by diving, always keeping
close together. At first they would remain under several
minutes, and would travel four hundred yards; as the chase
became hotter and hotter, the length of the dives gradually
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
decreased, so that, finally, the animals could hardly remain
below the surface. The launch was forced among the tumbling
mass of frightened creatures, and when directly over them, a
man in the bow would select a large one, and drive a harpoon
into it. The head of the harpoon was fastened by a few fathoms
of line to an empty water keg, and as soon as the harpoon was
fast the keg was thrown overboard. This harpooning is necessary,
as the animals sink as soon as they are killed, and the
buoyancy of the keg is required to keep them from being lost.
When one had been harpooned, the launch was stopped, and
the rest of the band continued to flee. Now comes the dangerous
moment of the chase. The wounded walrus rises to the
surface, and immediately attacks the launch, which it endeavours
to capsize by fixing its tusk over the side. Quick shooting
is the order, and even with a storm of bullets, many a monster
has to be rapped over the head or pushed away with guns and
spears. After this experience with the few first killed, it was
found that by keeping the propeller in motion and the whistle
blowing, they would not attack the launch, but would waste
their energies in an endeavour to destroy the keg; consequently
the danger of the sport was considerably lessened. Upwards of
half a dozen shots, at close range, were necessary to kill each
walrus. As soon as one was dispatched, it was towed to the
ship, or to a convenient cove at the shore. Seven were captured
during the day, and hoisted on board, where they completely
filled the after deck. Owing to the difficulty of securing these
large animals, at least twice that number, fatally wounded,
were lost; we later found this to be the usual proportion of
killed to captured, where these animals are hunted for their
skins and blubber, a waste of life altogether too great.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That evening the ship was headed for Cape Wolstenholme,
and early next morning came to anchor in Erik cove, close to
that headland. Advantage was taken of a fine convenient
stream of fresh water to fill the nearly empty tanks. During
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span>
the day, two large white bears were killed by the hunters. The
first was seen climbing along the steep cliffs fronting the harbour,
the second being found in a deep hole that it had dug
into a large snowbank, on the side of a high hill, and into which
it had retired for a cool sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Erik cove is an excellent harbour formed by a wide gully
in the high hills of this part of the coast. The bay extends
inland about two miles from the general coast-line; and good
anchorage is found within a quarter of a mile of its head. On
both sides, hills from 800 feet to 1,500 feet afford good protection
against all but north winds. Unfortunately the bay is
V-shaped, and quite open to the north, so that with strong
winds from that direction it would be unsafe, and, during the
season of ice, the danger would be considerably enhanced, as,
owing to its shape, the ice would be liable to block, and to force
a ship on shore without much chance of escape. A small river
which flows down the continuation of the gorge winds from side
to side of a low plain, which narrows as it extends backwards
from the sea, up the valley. An excellent site for houses might
be found on the plain near the mouth of the river.</p>

<h2>HUDSON BAY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Squalls of snow delayed us until the afternoon of the 13th,
when we steamed westward along the north side of Digges
islands. A bear was seen climbing over the cliffs, and a boat
was lowered in chase, but the animal escaped. In the evening,
the course was changed to northward, up Fox channel. At daylight
the next morning ice was met with some ten miles from
Leyson point. Steaming slowly through it, Seahorse point, on
Southampton island, was reached at noon, and a landing was
made with the launch. During the absence of the launch, the
ship was sent out into the ice to the northeast, in order to
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span>
examine its condition. It was found to be in large cakes of
heavy rafted ice, too solid to penetrate at such a late date.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/016a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_016' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Walrus in Smith Sound.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Seahorse point is at the junction of the granites and
gneisses with the Silurian limestones. There is here a marked
difference between the southern limestone area and the northern
country, underlain by the crystalline rocks, with its typical
long, low, rounded hills, lying in roughly parallel ridges, and
separated by wide shallow valleys, dotted with lakes and ponds,
or filled with coarse boulder clay, with boulders scattered in
bewildering profusion everywhere. This land, although high
by contrast with the limestone country, seldom reaches an
elevation of 500 feet, and that only far inland. There is one
conspicuous peak, which rises like a great sugar loaf, far inland,
its snow-capped summit of the lightest blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The limestone country occupies all the southern part of
this great island, and also underlies the large islands of Coats
and Mansfield farther to the south. The same physical characteristics
prevail wherever the limestone is found. The low
shores are bounded by gradually deepening water, broken by
dangerous reefs that extend several miles from the land. The
country rises very slowly inland, from the shores, in a succession
of low, broad terraces, each a few feet higher than the one
in front. These terraces are covered to a depth of several feet
by broken limestone, which affords perfect drainage, and in
consequence the surface is so dry that it will not even support
a covering of the hardy Arctic plants. This absence of vegetation
leaves the monotonous light-yellow shingle quite unrelieved
by any dash of other colour, and the general view is one of dry
desolation, much worse than that of the hilly country. The
limestone region never reaches an elevation of one hundred
feet within walking distance of the shore.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship lay-to during the night, among scattered pans of
ice, about five miles from the land, and in forty fathoms of
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>
water. Late in the evening two walruses were killed on ice
pans close to the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A return to the southward was made at daylight, and the
ice was finally left after passing Leyson point. During the
passage through the ice, in the early morning, hundreds of
walrus were seen asleep on the floating pans, and were left
undisturbed. Skirting the low shores of the so-called Bell
island, Evans strait was entered, and, late in the afternoon, we
passed close to Walrus island in Fisher strait. This island is
composed of crystalline rocks, and although not very high, it is
conspicuous in contrast to the low shores on both sides of the
strait. The island is much smaller than shown on the chart,
and is only one island, not two, as marked there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While passing through Evans and Fisher straits, soundings
were taken every five miles. The bottom was found to be very
even, and covered with fine sand or limestone debris. During
the day the low shores of Southampton were in sight, without
any feature sufficiently marked to afford a triangulation point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The absence of ice in any part of Fisher strait led to the
belief that no channel existed between Bell island and Southampton.
This has since been confirmed by the captains of the
<span class='it'>Era</span> and <span class='it'>Active</span>, both having narrowly escaped trouble in trying
to pass through this supposed channel, which, if it does exist,
is very shallow and narrow, even at high tide, and is so
obstructed with shoals as to be absolutely dangerous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the night of the 15th we passed the western entrance
of Fisher strait, and turned northward, up the west coast of
Southampton. Frequent soundings, taken as the ship passed
over, or very close to, the position of Tom island on the chart,
gave no indications of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This island was placed on the chart, on the authority of
Captain Lyon, but nobody has since seen it.
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span></p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Fullerton Harbour.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The 16th was thick and foggy, so that when the distance to
Cape Fullerton had been run down in the evening, and the
water had shoaled to twenty-five fathoms, the ship lay-to for the
night. In the morning, standing to the westward, breakers
were seen at nine o’clock; shortly after, several low islands were
passed, and at noon the launch was sent ahead to sound the way
into a long bay, which subsequently proved to be Winchester
inlet. A good harbour, sheltered by islands, was found on the
east side of the bay, and about three miles from its mouth,
where the anchor was dropped at six o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The country surrounding Winchester inlet is very similar
to that bounding the whole of the northwestern part of Hudson
bay. The country is underlain by Archæan crystalline rocks,
and has all the physical characteristics common to similar areas
in the south. Long, gently rounded hills, of slight elevation,
form the higher grounds, with wide, shallow valleys between
them. The whole has been intensely glaciated, and the abrasion
of the great ice-cap has reduced the general surface to as
near a level surface as is possible, considering the varying
resisting properties of the different rocks found here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no soil upon the rocky hills, while that of the valleys
is largely boulder clay, in which the coarser material predominates,
leaving little room for the growth of Arctic
vegetation upon the finer materials of the soil. Boulders scattered
in profusion over the rocky hills give to the latter a
peculiar ragged appearance. Lakes and ponds dot the valleys,
and much of the land surrounding these is low and swampy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The shores of the bay are low, and are masked, in most
places, by a wide fringe of low rocky islands, while beyond the
islands the danger zone is continued several miles seaward by a
labyrinth of sunken reefs. The bottom of the bay, beyond these
reefs, continues very uneven, so that in the portion between
Winchester and Chesterfield inlets there is danger of a ship
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>
grounding, when beyond the sight of the low shores. The
proximity to the magnetic pole accounts for the sluggishness
of the compass in these waters, where no reliance can be placed
on it. This, with the uncharted, low coast, bare of prominent
landmarks, renders the approach to any of the harbours uncertain
and dangerous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inland from the shores the country rises slowly; indeed, the
general elevation does not increase towards the interior above
ten feet a mile, while along the shores there are no hills more
than fifty feet high.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our instructions were to find, and, if possible, to pass the
winter in company with the American whaling ship known to
be in Hudson bay. The whalers formerly wintered at Marble
island, or at Depot island; the former is to the southward of the
mouth of Chesterfield inlet, the latter close to the entrance of
Winchester inlet. Marble island has long been abandoned,
chiefly on account of its insufficient water supply. Within the
last few years a more convenient harbour was found close to
Cape Fullerton, and the large launch was fitted out to search
for it, the <span class='it'>Era</span> not being in the harbour at Depot island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strong gale lasted from the 18th to the 22nd, and we were
very lucky to be in such a good harbour. While awaiting
an abatement of the gale, several Eskimos came overland to the
ship, and were taken aboard. They were from Cape Fullerton,
and were going inland from Winchester inlet to kill barren-ground
caribou for their winter clothing. They had seen the
ship as she passed, but could not reach us with their whaleboats
owing to the gale. We learned from them that the <span class='it'>Era</span> was
already in winter quarters at Fullerton. This information
rendered the proposed trip in the launch useless, and it was
therefore determined to send her up Chesterfield inlet, as the
only place where a sufficient supply of deerskins for our winter
clothing could be procured from the natives. The services of
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>
an old Eskimo, named Scotty, were secured as pilot for the
launch, while another, Gilbert, consented to pilot the ship to
Fullerton harbour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crew of the launch consisted of the second mate, third
engineer, a fireman, sailor, the interpreter, Scotty and myself.
We left the ship early on the morning of the 23rd, and the
launch behaved admirably in the heavy head sea raised by the
recent gale. A southerly course was followed, past Depot
island, but the numerous shoals gradually forced us away from
the mainland, so that the boat was ten miles from the mainland
at the mouth of Chesterfield inlet, and even at that distance
considerable difficulty was experienced in keeping clear of the
shoals. They were eventually passed without mishap, and the
course was changed to westward along the south side of Promise
island, and then along that of the inlet, so that by dark we were
fifty miles above its mouth. After steaming twenty miles
farther, on the following morning the lower Eskimo settlement
was reached, situated on a large bay on the north side of the
inlet. All the men were absent hunting deer, and although
there were many skins about the encampment, the women would
not part with them without the permission of the men. The
latter were not expected back until the next evening, so it was
determined to continue on to the upper encampment, located
thirty miles above the lower, on the southern channel, past
Bowell island, where the inlet discharges from Baker lake.
This encampment was reached early in the afternoon, and the
absent hunters were signalled for with smoke. They arrived
about two hours after us, and a lively barter was kept up until
after dark, upwards of fifty skins and a considerable quantity
of meat being purchased for powder, tobacco, knives and files.
Four tents of Eskimos were at this place, which is a noted
crossing of the deer in their annual migrations to the north and
south. Great numbers had already been killed, and half-putrid
heads were scattered in all directions about the tents.
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Early next morning the launch was headed east, and,
assisted by a strong tide, soon reached the lower encampment.
The men were still absent, and did not return until the following
morning, when we secured about as many skins and as much
meat as at the upper camp. Leaving early in the afternoon,
we continued down the inlet; at dark, the pilot became confused
amongst the many islands off Dangerous point, and advised
anchoring until daylight. An anchor watch was set, and the
remainder of the crew went to sleep, to be awakened at midnight
by the startling news that the launch was aground and the tide
still falling. Efforts were immediately made to float her, but
without avail. She soon fell over on her side, when the water
rushed in, partly filling her. Some of the crew were then set
to ferrying the cargo to a neighbouring island, while the rest
bailed out the water and endeavoured to keep it out as the tide
rose again, but without success, so the energies of all were
devoted to saving everything possible. Many things were lost
during the hurry and darkness, and daylight came to a cold and
forlorn party stranded on a small island. Arrangements were
made, during the morning, to erect the boat mast as a Spanish
windlass, and with the assistance of the small boat to raise
the launch upright with the next rising tide. Unfortunately
the tide did not fall low enough to free the boat of water, or to
permit a fair trial of our improvised tackle. The ponds of fresh
water were already frozen over, and the weather was becoming
cold and boisterous; not a day, therefore, could be lost in sending
the twelve-foot dinghy to Fullerton for assistance. The
energies of the party were now devoted to transferring the goods
and cargo from the island to the mainland, about a mile distant,
as it would not do to leave the party on an island without means
of reaching the shores of the inlet. This work continued until
dark, when, after a hurried meal, Wells, Ford and Scotty were
sent off in the dinghy, with instructions to reach the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> as
soon as possible; the remainder of the party, wrapped in their
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
blankets, laid down for a deserved rest. The following days
were spent in drying and cleaning the skins and other articles
saved from the wreck, and in hunting and fishing, neither of
which was successful.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Wreck Camp, Chesterfield Inlet.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>During these days the weather became cold, and several
inches of snow fell, which added to the discomfort of our temporary
shelter. Early on the afternoon of the 3rd of October
the smoke of the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> was seen far down the inlet, and she
came to anchor at dark in a harbour about ten miles to the east
of the camp. Captain Comer, of the <span class='it'>Era</span>, in one of his whaleboats
manned by natives was the first to arrive the next
morning, and was followed later by three of the ship’s boats.
Ropes were fastened to the launch and boats, and as the tide
rose the wreck was lifted from the bottom and buoyed into
shoaler water alongside the island, where it was left until the
next tide. Leaving sufficient men to continue the work,
Captain Bartlett and the writer started in the whaleboat,
double-manned, for the ship late in the afternoon. We had gone
only a short distance when a heavy snowstorm came on. We
continued rowing in this very thick weather until ten o’clock,
when, within a couple of miles of the ship, we were obliged to
stop owing to the intense darkness. We landed on a small island
and made a partial shelter from the storm by placing the boat
sail against a low cliff. The quarters were so small that all
were obliged to stand, and so the night was passed. Next
morning it took two hours to dig the sail from under the snow,
after which we resumed our journey to the ship and only
reached it by the help of a long line attached to a keg, paid out
to us from the ship, which was reached at eleven o’clock, after
an exciting and exhausting twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crew of the dinghy had made excellent time on their trip
to Fullerton to seek relief. The first night they made only a
few miles, being very tired and having a strong tide against
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>
them. The next day the mouth of the inlet was reached; the
night following they slept at Depot island. Next day with a
fair wind and heavy sea they arrived close to Fullerton, and
reached the ship the following morning. The <span class='it'>Neptune</span> started
to our relief that afternoon, and anchored for the night off
Depot island, Captain Comer, who had kindly volunteered,
acting as pilot. The next day, when out of sight of land, on
the north side of the entrance to Chesterfield inlet, the ship
struck twice, and was in shallow water all the way to Promise
island, after which the water of the inlet was found to be uniformly
deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gale in which we reached the ship continued for three
days. On the evening of the 3rd of October the men with the
boats returned to the ship, and reported having had a very
rough time of it, in the makeshift camp there. On the 8th the
ship steamed up the inlet and anchored close to the sunken
launch. Efforts to bring her alongside the ship were immediately
undertaken, and next morning she was successfully
hoisted aboard. In the afternoon we started down the inlet,
and anchored for the night a few miles above Promise island.
On the 10th a heavy gale blew from the westward, accompanied
by frequent, thick snow squalls. The anchor was raised at daylight
on the morning following, when, keeping well to the
southward of the shoals beyond the mouth of the inlet, we
arrived safely at Fullerton at dusk that evening.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>WINTER QUARTERS AT FULLERTON.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Neptune</span> had safely arrived at Fullerton harbour on the
23rd September, and had dropped anchor close alongside the
<span class='it'>Era</span>. Major Moodie, after looking over the ground, decided
to erect a Police Post on the large island at the rear of the
harbour. The lumber for the building was immediately landed,
and before the ship left for Chesterfield inlet the frame of the
dwelling had been erected and its sides partly boarded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The harbour of Fullerton is formed by a number of small
islands, situated on the east side at the mouth of a long bay,
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>
and about five miles from Cape Fullerton, at the entrance to
Roes Welcome. The harbour is quite small, with room for
about three ships, and is fully protected by the islands and reefs
surrounding it. The usual entrance is from the westward,
where the channel is not above fifty yards wide, and the water
at high tide is only five fathoms deep. The eastern entrance is
narrower, and a ship is obliged to make several sharp turns
when passing through it. Owing to the low even coast, without
any landmark in the vicinity, the position of the harbour is
difficult to locate without entering the wide danger-zone of
shoals. The wide fringe of islands to the westward practically
ends at Fullerton, so that a ship making the coast may know
the position by the presence or absence of islands; but as the
islands are very low it is hard to distinguish them from the
mainland at a safe distance away, as the shoals and reefs extend
more than five miles beyond the harbour. The surveys made
in the spring of 1904 show that a fairly safe channel will be
found by keeping well to the eastward of the harbour, and by
then following a northwest course, keeping in line the beacons
on a small island about a mile outside the harbour. When the
Beacon island is reached the ship should pass in mid-channel
between it and the adjoining island to the westward; passing
these, the outer harbour island should be given a wide berth,
until the entrance to the harbour is opened fully, a long shoal
extending from the western point of the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the return of the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> to Fullerton, immediate
preparations were made for the coming winter. The first
undertaking was the cutting of a large quantity of ice, from a
fresh-water pond close to the house and about a mile distant
from the ship. The ice was about nine inches thick, and one
day’s work, by the entire crew, sufficed to cut and to store
enough to supply the ship with fresh water until the ponds
melted again in the spring. The detachment of Mounted Police,
assisted by some of the crew of the <span class='it'>Era</span>, were busily engaged
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
in finishing their house and shed. Floating ice soon hampered
landing operations. On the 17th October the ice in the harbour
set fast and, soon after, the work of transporting materials to
and from the shore was done with sleds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the end of the month, the ship had been placed in a north-and-south
position, so that her bow faced north into the prevailing
cold winds. The decks were covered with a temporary roof,
made from a part of the lumber intended for the police buildings.
This housing kept the snow from the decks, and greatly
increased the inclosed space on the ship. It later proved so
comfortable that the carpenter worked in it, almost without
interruption, throughout the winter, at the repairs to the launch.
The house and shed were made weather-proof, and a supply of
provisions and outfit, sufficient to keep the ship’s company until
the following summer, was stored in them, as a precaution
against the destruction of the ship by fire. The galley was
moved from the deck to between-decks, and the range connected
with two large copper tanks, in which the daily supply of ice
was melted; at the same time all the provisions likely to be
injured by frost were stored alongside the range. All the oil
and powder were stored on an island away from the provisions,
and the boats placed either on shore, or on the ice alongside the
ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly after our arrival the natives congregated about the
ships, and to avoid misunderstanding, an agreement was made
with Captain Comer, that he should care for the Aivillik tribe,
while the Kenipitu tribe would belong to the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>. By this
arrangement, about a dozen able-bodied men and their families
fell to our portion, and about double that number to the <span class='it'>Era</span>.
The men were employed, during our stay at Fullerton, in banking
the ship with snow, hauling ice and other necessary outside
work. Several of them hunted continuously, and at small cost
kept the ship in fresh caribou meat throughout the winter.
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>
They received little pay beyond their food, which consisted
chiefly of the scraps left from the meals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Faribault had shown signs of mild insanity, almost from
the time of leaving Halifax. On the 1st of November he
became violently insane, when, on the advice of Dr. Borden,
he was placed in charge of the police as a dangerous lunatic.
The poor man had to be confined in a cell, and watched continuously.
His condition became worse and worse, until he
was happily released by death on the 27th of April following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the ice became sufficiently thick to bear the load,
a wall of snow about three feet thick was erected around the
ship, and raised to the top of the temporary decking. Sails,
spread on the roof, were covered with about a foot of snow. By
these means all draughts were effectually kept out of the ship,
and the temperature of the interior was raised several degrees.
Holes were cut in the banking to allow light to enter the ports
and windows, and snow porches were erected over the exits on
each side; the deep holes at the ports resembled embrasures,
and the general appearance of the ship was that of a floating
fort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the labour for preparing for the winter was finished,
the ordinary work about the ship was hardly enough to keep the
crew in health, and all were encouraged to hunt or attend lines
of fox-traps for exercise. This proved much better than formal
exercise at stated times, and the general health remained good
throughout this long period of enforced idleness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only two meals were cooked daily during the short days of
mid-winter, breakfast being at ten and dinner at four, an informal
supper being provided in the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Games and cards were provided for the use of all; musical
instruments, including a piano, were in frequent use, while a
weekly lecture, dance and newspaper went far to agreeably
pass away the long winter evenings, which were further relieved
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
by visits between the ships, and to the snowhouses of the natives
built on the ice close alongside.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Snowhouses on Ice, near the ‘Neptune.’</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the night of the 11th of December a second sad occurrence
happened. When everybody was busy preparing letters
for the mail about to be sent to Churchill by a couple of
Eskimos from Baker lake, James O’Connel, a cabin-boy of weak
mind, left the ship to go to the snowhouses, and wandered away
in a snowstorm, which commenced shortly after his departure.
He had been in the habit of hiding behind the launch, or in
other places about the decks, where he would remain for hours,
and, in consequence, his absence was unnoticed by his mess
mates until the following morning. Immediately upon the
alarm being given, the crews of both ships and all the natives
turned out and searched systematically, in all directions from
the ship, but, owing to the blizzard, without success. The storm
continued to rage during the next two days, so that it was only
on the 15th that definite information concerning his fate was
obtained by the natives, who traced his track in the snow to
the open water in the southwest some three miles from the ship,
where the poor fellow had gone before the strong wind. There
is no doubt that death came quickly, and we were relieved of
the thoughts of his possible sufferings had he continued to
wander about the country and finally died of exhaustion and
cold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The short days of mid-winter and the excessive cold of the
early spring practically rendered impossible any surveying or
other outside scientific work until the month of April, when
preparations were made for exploratory and surveying work.
During the winter Mr. Crossman made a very efficient ice-boring
machine, which worked admirably in making holes for sounding
through the thick ice. Weather observations were taken
five times daily during our stay at Fullerton, and these,
together with the readings taken on the voyage, are printed in
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>
Appendix No. I., where also will be found a summary of the
climatic conditions, prepared from the observations by Mr.
Stupart, Superintendent of the Canadian Meteorological Service.
A list giving the thickness, week by week, of the ice in
the harbour, will also be found in that appendix, and is interesting
as showing to what a late date the ice continues to
increase, the maximum thickness of seventy-four inches having
been obtained on the 25th April.</p>

<h2>SPRING  EXPLORATIONS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On the 11th April Mr. Caldwell left the ship, accompanied
by five natives, with instructions to explore the coast northward
to Wager inlet; and if the conditions of weather, food and dog-food
would permit, to continue his work to Repulse bay,
returning before the ice along the coast broke up. His outfit
and provisions were carried upon two dog sleds, one of which
was to return after helping him over the rough ice of the shore
of Roes Welcome. He succeeded in the exploration of Wager
inlet, but, owing to the delays caused by bad weather, was
unable to reach Repulse bay. Mr. Caldwell on his trip did a
large amount of excellent work in surveying the coast-line and
examining the rocks met with along the route.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same time Mr. King was engaged, when the weather
permitted, in making an accurate plan of Fullerton harbour,
the channel of approach and the environments within a radius
of thirty miles of the ship. Several hundred soundings were
made with the aid of the boring machine, the soundings being
under the charge of Mr. Ross. As a result an accurate chart
of the harbour and channel has been prepared for the use of the
ships calling there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Owing to the serious illness of Dr. Faribault, whose death
was expected daily, and to other causes, I could not leave the
ship on any long trips at this time, and my out-door work was
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
confined to the superintendence of the surveys, and to such
geological work as could be accomplished within a day’s journey
of the ship.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/030a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_030' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Hauling the Winter Water Supply.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the 4th of May, accompanied by two Eskimos, I left for
an exploratory trip along the coast to the mouth of Chesterfield
inlet, in order to connect the work of Caldwell with that of
Tyrrell. This work was accomplished in ten days, during part
of which we were confined to our tent, and almost buried by the
heaviest snowstorm of the year. A sketch survey was carried to
the mouth of the inlet, and all rock exposures on the way were
examined. The rocks met with were chiefly granite, with
masses of dark schists inclosed in the granite areas. Some of
the schists were cut by quartz veins, which carried small quantities
of pyrite, but nowhere sufficiently concentrated to be of
value. The most promising locality seen was on the islands a
few miles to the westward of Fullerton, where the veins were
numerous, and where the natives report some veins well
mineralized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the return journey the country about Winchester inlet
was examined inland for a distance of forty miles. A description
of its physical character has already been given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Caldwell arrived back safely on the 30th of May. The
first rain fell on the 21st, after which the weather gradually
lost its wintry character, and although by no means warm, was
sufficiently moderate to allow the surveying work to go on without
much discomfort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the first week in June all hands were busy removing
the winter coverings, and getting the ship in order for the
coming summer.</p>

<h2>WHALEBOAT TRIP TO SOUTHAMPTON ISLAND.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Captain Comer had kindly invited me to accompany his
boats on a whaling trip to Southampton island, and for this
purpose had lent me two boats fitted with covers for the trip.
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>
Accompanied by Dr. Borden, two seamen and six Eskimos, we
left the ship on the morning of the 15th June, being transported
to Cape Fullerton over the shore-ice by dog-teams to where the
boats were found hauled out on the ice close to its edge. The
morning was quite cold and boisterous, and not at all pleasant
for a boat cruise. Our boats and the four belonging to the <span class='it'>Era</span>
were soon loaded and launched. A fair wind allowed us to sail
northward through a narrow lead of open water between the
shore-ice and the moving pack, which completely covered the
sea outside. Early in the afternoon we reached the other boats,
manned by natives, hauled out on the ice and covered in for
cooking operations. A cup of hot coffee soon reduced the chill
received in the boats. The journey was then resumed, but in a
short time the ice closed in on the shore, obliging us to haul our
boats on to the solid ice, where they were propped upright, and
soon roofed with cotton covers stretched over light wooden
frames. This turned each boat into commodious and comfortable
sleeping quarters, and soon the evening meal was being
cooked over the oil stoves. The ice remained tight on the coast,
and it was only with great difficulty that the boats were forced
through it a few miles to Whale point, where we remained
hemmed in the next day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Whale point a small house was erected some years ago as
a station by one of the American whalers. It is situated on the
summit of the point, and a ladder leads to the roof, where a
small platform served as a lookout station for whales swimming
in the ice-laden waters of Roes Welcome. This is a favourite
camping ground for the Aivillik natives in the early summer,
whales, seals and walrus being then plentiful in the adjoining
waters, and the barren-ground caribou numerous within a short
distance of the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to Captain Comer, more whales have been killed
within sight of Whale point than in all the rest of Hudson
bay; on this account, and from the ease with which it might be
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
supplied, it would probably prove an excellent place for a post
from which to control the whale fishery. The water supply,
obtained from small pools in the rocks, is rather bad, owing to
the number of dogs and natives about.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/032a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_032' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Mr. Caldwell Starting North.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Two days were occupied in crossing from Whale point to
Southampton island, and as Roes Welcome was full of floating
ice, several exciting moments were experienced when the ice
came together with each change of tide, threatening to crush
the boats if not quickly hauled out on a convenient heavy pan.
The monotony was also broken by the capture of a bear and
several large seals. We remained in company with the whalers
for two days after reaching the island, and coasted southward to
Cape Kendall without seeing any sign of a whale. As our work
was chiefly on land, we then determined to part company, they
continuing southward while we made inland excursions. The
ice was still fast to the shore, from which it extended seaward
from two to six miles. The boats were of necessity at the edge
of the ice, and the long tramp through deep slush and water
to and from the shore was fatiguing and cold. Only the ridges
on the land were free of snow, which was still deep in all the
hollows. The weather was now sufficiently warm to keep the
snow soft and wet, and to make a passage from one ridge to
another necessitated wading waist deep through the snow.
Under these conditions extensive journeys inland were impossible,
and we were confined to the shores of the island. Good
collections of fossils from the limestones of the island were
obtained, and a large number of bird skins and eggs were collected.
It was unfortunately too early in the season for plants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The western shores of Southampton are low. The land
behind rises in a succession of ridges each a few feet higher
than the one immediately in front. These ridges are formed
of broken limestone, evidently the surface portion of underlying
ledges. Very little vegetation grows on the ridges, but in the
wide depressions between them there is a profusion of grasses
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
and other Arctic plants on the wet ground surrounding the
many ponds and lakes found there. The shores and islands of
these lakes are the breeding grounds of a number of rare birds,
among which may be mentioned Sabine’s Gull, Arctic Tern,
Whistling Swan, Hutchen’s Goose, Snow Goose, Jager, Little
Blue Crane and Red Phalarope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The water is usually very shallow for two or three miles from
the land, and reefs of limestone extend much farther out.
About Cape Kendall dangerous reefs are found at least eight
miles from the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We remained on the island a week, gradually working northward,
until we were about ten miles to the north of our original
landing place, or some forty miles beyond Cape Kendall.
Advantage was taken of a fine evening to re-cross Roes Welcome,
and we started at midnight in broad daylight. Shortly
after leaving, a large whale came to the surface close to the boats
and remained in the vicinity for upwards of thirty minutes.
The crossing was safely made during the day, the only incident
being the meeting in mid-channel of an extensive mass of very
heavy ice, some of its pinnacles being upwards of thirty feet
above the water; the natives said it was a large floe from Fox
channel. We were obliged to sail several miles to the northward
in order to pass this floe, and so reached the mainland a
few miles south of the mouth of Wager inlet, and a like distance
from Yellow bluff, where the Aivilliks spend the late summer.
Nothing of note occurred on the passage down the coast, and
the ship was again reached on the 2nd of July.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little change was apparent in the condition of the ice since
our departure, and the solid floe, extending a couple of miles
beyond the harbour, gave little hope of the ship being released
by the approaching high tides. The ship was now ready to
leave as soon as the ice would permit, but this did not happen
until the 18th, a marvellous change taking place daily in the
condition of the ice for a week previous to that date.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>HUDSON BAY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The anchor was hoisted and the moorings to the ice cast off at
two o’clock on the morning of the 18th of July, when the
<span class='it'>Neptune</span> proceeded to break her way out of Fullerton harbour,
after having been nine months there fast frozen in the ice.
Little difficulty was experienced in breaking the harbour ice,
when, following a pilot boat, the narrow eastern entrance was
soon passed and the ship was once more free. Loose stringers
of small ice extended a few miles from the shore, after which
only occasional lumps were seen during the day, as the ship
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>
steamed across to Cape Kendall, and then followed the west
coast of Southampton southward. The southwest point of the
island was passed before midnight. This point lies well to the
northward of its position on the chart, or in about 63°
N. latitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The low southern shore of Southampton was followed during
the night, and only a few stringers of ice were met with. At
four o’clock in the morning the island was lost to sight, and by
noon we were steaming along the equally low shores of Coats
island, with the small but prominent Walrus island in sight to
the northward. Ice to the northward gradually forced the ship
closer to the shores of Coats, where, after passing a wide
bay, partly filled with large, low islands, we coasted within two
miles of a prominent headland about four hundred feet high,
which forms the northeast cape of Coats, and which was named
Cape Préfontaine in honour of the Honourable the Minister of
Marine and Fisheries. These highlands appear to traverse the
island diagonally in a southwest direction, coming out at a
lower altitude on the south side of the island several miles west
of Cape Pembroke. This ridge is due to a band of crystalline
rocks, which rises from beneath the low flat limestones forming
the remainder of the island. A large whale was seen while
passing through Fisher strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond Cape Préfontaine the ice became more plentiful,
and many large pans were met with. The ice had the appearance
of being lately broken up, and owing to its smooth unrafted
condition we judged it came from Fisher strait, rather than
from Fox channel to the northward. During the night this ice
forced the ship southward into the channel between Coats and
Mansfield, so that the western shore of the latter was reached
some twenty-five miles to the south of its northern end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Open leads in the ice were found from three to five miles
from that island, and no difficulty was experienced in gaining
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>
its north end. This island of limestone is somewhat higher than
Coats and Southampton, rising inland in low broad terraces to
an elevation of upwards of a hundred feet. Small patches of
snow were seen under banks and along the faces of the terraces,
but elsewhere the green colour showed that considerable vegetation
covered the greater part of its surface.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/036a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_036' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Midnight in Smith Sound.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similar lanes of water, between large cakes of ice, afforded
an easy passage from Mansfield to Digges islands. A great
amount of ice was seen to the southward, apparently completely
filling the channel between Mansfield and the mainland. To
the northward some open water occurred, but the patches became
smaller and smaller as Digges was approached, and finally
ceased to the eastward of these islands, the southern part of the
western end of Hudson strait being completely filled with ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strong southerly wind had been blowing all day, and it was
hoped that it had loosened the ice along the southern shore of
the strait. The ship was taken under the land, but without
success, so that after butting through the slowly closing ice all
night, we were finally tightly beset in the early morning, about
three miles from the eastern Digges island. The 21st was
foggy, with snow flurries in the morning and showers in the
afternoon; the ice remained tight about the ship all day, and
she drifted eastward with the ice, passing Cape Wolstenholme,
and in the evening being about five miles to the east of Erik
cove. At that time considerable open water could be seen about
five miles from the ship to the eastward, with a few narrow
lanes in the rear, and other small openings to the northward,
where the dark sky showed considerable open water beyond our
view.</p>

<h2>HUDSON STRAIT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Persistent ramming forced the ship through about five miles
of ice on the morning of the 22nd, when she was again tightly
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>
beset until the evening, at that time being about twenty-five
miles to the eastward of Cape Wolstenholme, this distance having
been made by the drift of the ice. The ice slackened again
at eight o’clock in the evening, when after an hour’s heavy work
we got into a lead of open water under the land, and continued
at full speed all night, steaming east in a lane from two to four
miles wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At five o’clock next morning we were off Deception bay and
the western end of Charles island. The bold coast along which
we had been passing all night now became less abrupt, and this
change was accompanied by shallower water in the sea fronting
it, so that when seven miles from the mouth of the bay, soundings
taken at the edge of the ice only gave twelve fathoms, with
indications of an uneven bottom, where it would be dangerous
to be caught in the ice if the wind should change and force it
upon the land. The ship was turned into the ice, and in an
hour had reached a place of safety. In the afternoon, with
clearing weather, the ice opened, and not much difficulty was
experienced in forcing between the loose pans, first towards the
east end of Charles island and later more easterly, so that when
the ice again closed we were about ten miles northeast of Cape
Weggs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the night and following morning we continued to
drift rapidly to the eastward. Before noon we were opposite
the mouth of Douglas harbour, having made fully twenty miles
of drift during that interval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ice began to slacken at ten o’clock, when we got under
way, and forcing the ship towards the north at noon we were in
open water, with a heavy northerly swell, which showed an open
sea in that direction. Only a few small icebergs and broken
pans of ice were seen during the remainder of the trip to Port
Burwell, which we reached on the evening of the 25th, but in
crossing Ungava bay the lower temperature and an ice-glint to
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
the southward indicated some ice in the southern part of that
bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following summary of the condition and extent of the
ice met with on the passage from Fullerton to Port Burwell
may prove of interest and value. The northwestern part of
Hudson bay was quite free of ice, and none to obstruct navigation
was found in Fisher and Evans straits. Large quantities
of ice were encountered between the mouth of Evans strait and
Digges at the western end of Hudson strait, but without serious
trouble safe passages were found through it, and there is no
doubt that an ordinary unprotected iron steamship would have
passed through it at that time without trouble or danger. This
ice, evidently the product of the past winter, consisted chiefly,
as has been mentioned, of large flat sheets that had only a short
time previously broken from their original position, for there
were no signs that it had been subjected to pressure or to the
action of a swell. The edges of these large cakes had not been
crushed, and many soft thin spots were seen which would
disappear with the slightest pressure or swell. Along with
the predominating flat ice was a considerable amount of rafted
ice of the same character, and also of portions apparently subjected
to pressure during the past winter. All the ice was
comparatively light and thin, which led to the belief that it had
come out of Fisher strait, and from the southward up the
channel between Mansfield and the eastern mainland, the meeting
of these streams producing the blockade at the western end
of Hudson strait. Owing to its thinness and rotten character,
the greater part of this ice would melt a few days after we
passed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ice in the western part of Hudson strait was somewhat
heavier than that described above. Much of it was rafted ice
in small cakes, and there was a small number of ancient, heavy,
discoloured pans that had evidently come from Fox channel.
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
This ice completely filled the side of the strait, and probably
extended to Nottingham island, but there was open water on the
north side of the strait through which the whaler <span class='it'>Active</span> had
already passed on her way into Hudson bay. The important
point to be noted is that during all the times that the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>
was beset by the ice during the passage east along the south side
of the strait, there was never any sign of the surrounding ice
rafting by the pressure occasioned at the change of tides, and
never was the pressure about the ship sufficient to cause damage
to an unprotected iron ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is little doubt that if a more northerly course had been
taken on the passage eastward much more open water would
have been found, including an unobstructed passage from at
least the western end of Charles island, while to the westward
open lanes would probably have extended from the neighbourhood
of Nottingham island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the early part of July ships proceeding out of Hudson
bay will probably find on the southern side of Hudson strait,
or rather on the southern side of the mid-channel, the best and
safest passage, owing to the easterly currents of that side.
Ships entering Hudson bay at this time should follow the
northern side of the strait, keeping as far as possible away from
the land, especially that of Big island, until that island is
passed, when the mid-channel should be held past Nottingham
island, and from there the course should be laid to pass within
easy distance of the north end of Mansfield island. The strong
tides in the eastern part of the strait, and especially about Big
island, cause the ice to close with considerable pressure at the
change of tide, and this dangerous pressure is most severe close
to the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We arrived at Port Burwell on the date arranged before
leaving Halifax for meeting the relief ship. By a coincidence
the <span class='it'>Erik</span>, bringing our supply of coal and fresh provisions,
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
arrived in port only an hour ahead of the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>. The ships
were soon moored alongside, and the mail from civilization was
distributed to the ship’s company, this being the first news of
the outside world received in eleven months.</p>

<h2>VOYAGE TO THE ARCTIC ISLANDS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A week was spent at Port Burwell, transferring the coals
and provisions from the <span class='it'>Erik</span> to the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>, and in landing
a large quantity of coal and provisions for the use of the Northwest
Mounted Police. All this work having been finished, both
ships weighed anchor early on the morning of the 2nd of
August, the <span class='it'>Erik</span> bound south for Newfoundland and the
<span class='it'>Neptune</span> northward for Smith sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Major Moodie having decided to return to Ottawa, left on
the <span class='it'>Erik</span>, and that ship also carried our second steward, who
was invalided home, along with a sailor of the <span class='it'>Era</span> who, during
the past winter, had nearly died of scurvy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The course was laid across the mouth of the strait, and at
noon the snow-covered cliffs of Cape Resolution bore north-northeast,
distant about twenty miles. A few icebergs were
passed during the afternoon, but no field ice was seen until the
following evening, when a few heavy pans were met. As the
weather was thick with fog the ship slowed down for the night,
and the course was changed more to the eastward. Thick fog
continued until the afternoon of the 6th, when, the weather
clearing, we found ourselves about twenty miles to the westward
of the great island of Disko, on the coast of Greenland. The
scenery of the island is very grand; the shore-line is deeply
indented by narrow bays, from which the land rises abruptly
into irregular mountain masses, terminating in sharp peaks,
whose loftier summits were hidden in the straight line of clouds
formed from the recently risen fog. All the higher valleys
were filled with great glaciers pouring slowly down into a sea
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>
dotted with numerous fantastic icebergs. The contrast between
the dark sombre rocks of the hills and the dazzling whiteness of
the glaciers was enhanced by the streams of sunlight which
flooded the interior, while the coast was veiled by the fog clouds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The weather remained clear throughout the night and next
day, as we passed northward along the rugged coast of Greenland,
catching many views of its great ice-cap behind the
numerous high islands that fringe the coast. The greater part
of the surface of these islands was free from snow; glaciers
were only seen in the higher valleys. The ice in the long fiords
and the channels had broken up and been carried away, so that
only numerous icebergs were seen along the shores. In the
afternoon considerable heavy field ice was passed on the west.
Our noon observation placed us about twenty miles off the
Danish settlement of Upernivik, to the northward of which
the sea was filled with great icebergs, they being especially
numerous in the neighbourhood of the Devils Thumb island,
so named on account of the prominent peak bearing some resemblance
to that member.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Duck islands had been reached the ship’s course
was changed to westward to cross the dreaded Melville bay.
This great bay owes its bad name to the quantities of heavy ice
infesting its waters during the early summer, and the whalers
count themselves lucky if the delay does not exceed three weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We steamed directly across for Cape York, ahead of a strong
gale of wind accompanied by heavy rain and sleet, and saw no
ice until within a short distance of the cape, where broken floes
and icebergs formed a fringe extending a mile or so from the
land. Continuing westward close along the outer margin of the
ice we were abreast of Cape York at three in the afternoon,
having made a record passage across the bay.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/042a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_042' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Parker Snow Bay, North Greenland.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The weather becoming very thick, we shortly after stood
inside the outer stringers of ice, and kept close to the ironbound
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>
coast in order to sight Conical island, and so reach the fine
harbour of Parker Snow bay just inside the island; this was
successfully accomplished, and the ship was brought to anchor
near the head of the bay. The wind freshened during the night,
and in the morning blew so strongly that it was impossible to
reach the shore with the ship’s boat. At noon the wind registered
forty-eight miles an hour, and some of the gusts were
much stronger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind fell towards evening, allowing us to land. We
were now well north of the Arctic circle, and a bright sun remained
visible all night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An ascent of one of the glaciers at the head of the bay
afforded valuable information concerning the ice-cap and glacial
phenomena, discussed later in the report. A sharp rocky hill,
960 feet high, divides the glaciers; this was crossed and the
descent made by the second glacier, where much trouble was
experienced crossing the deep gullies cut into it by surface
streams of water. Neither of these glaciers discharges into the
sea, their fronts terminating against high steep banks of boulder
clay brought from above by the moving ice. A light pink
gneiss, cut by many veins of quartz apparently all quite barren,
is the chief rock of these hills. The hills surrounding Parker
Snow bay rise in abrupt cliffs nearly 1,500 feet above the
water; the country then rises less abruptly another thousand
feet to the lower level of the great ice-cap which covers the
entire interior of Greenland.</p>

<h2>SMITH SOUND.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>On our return to the ship the anchor was raised and we left
the bay, passing the great Petiwik glacier at midnight, with
the sun shining over the top of its five-mile front of ice, which
ends in abrupt low cliffs of ice rising directly from the sea.
Large icebergs are frequently broken from this long face, and
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>
hundreds of them are seen aground on ledges for miles on both
sides of the glacier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The westward course was followed a few miles farther, after
which the ship turned north through the fine channel between
Cape Atholl and Wolstenholm island. A small amount of
loose ice was met with in the channel and in the crossing to
Saunders island. The crystalline rocks which occupy the coast
from Cape York give place here and to the northward to almost
horizontal beds of sandstones and lighter coloured rock, probably
limestone. Large masses of dark trap are associated with
these bedded rocks, either as sills injected along the bedding,
or as dikes approaching more or less closely to the vertical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cape Parry was passed at eight o’clock on the morning of
the 10th, when, crossing the mouth of Whale sound, we followed
the channel between Northumberland and Herbert islands,
having a fine view of their high cliffs of sandstone and light-coloured
rock, which rise almost perpendicularly from 500 to
1,000 feet above the sea. Similar cliffs occupy the coast of the
mainland from the north side of Inglefield gulf to the neighbourhood
of Etah, at the narrowest part of Smith sound. The
day was very fine, and only a few loose pans of floe ice and
many icebergs embarrassed the course followed by the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The upper portions of Whale sound, Inglefield gulf and
McCormick bay were filled with ice, which from a distance
appeared to be still unbroken from the shores. During the day
walrus were frequently seen in groups upon the floating pans
of ice, where many large seals lay basking in the sun. The
walrus were most numerous on the ice between Cape Alexander
and Etah, where attempts were made to photograph the larger
groups, but without success, as it was late in the evening and
the animals were unusually wild.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the coast is followed northward the cliffs and the mainland
behind become lower, so that about Cape Alexander the
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>
general level of the front of the ice-cap does not appear to be
greatly over 1,000 feet in elevation.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>A Glacier of Bylot Island.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the trip northward the ship passed close to several of the
places where the Eskimo usually reside during the summer
months, but no signs of them were seen as far north as the
Littleton islands, whence we crossed to Cape Sabine, after making
a call into the harbour of Etah, famous as the most northern
human habitation on the earth, being 78° 30´ N. latitude. At
Etah we saw a number of deserted underground houses, where
the natives live during the winter, and a small quantity of coal
left by Peary, who used this place as headquarters during one
of his attempts to reach the pole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Our voyage northward was stopped by heavy sheets of Arctic
ice coming down Smith sound in the vicinity of the Littleton
islands. Into this neighbourhood it would be dangerous and
foolish to force the ship for no definite purpose. A crossing
was therefore made to Cape Sabine, and considerable anxiety
for the ship’s safety was felt passing between the great pans of
thick solid ice, some of which were miles in extent, and rose
from three to six feet above the water, with pinnacles of much
greater height. Some very hard knocks were given to the ship
as she was forced through the heavy ice from one lead of water
to the next, and everybody felt relieved when the little harbour
at Cape Sabine was reached in safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A landing was made here, and a visit paid to the last winter
quarters of Peary, which are situated near the eastern end of
the cape on the side of Payer harbour, formed by a few small
islands lying a short distance from the cape. The harbour
being full of ice, the ship could not enter it, but stood off under
steam, it being dangerous to anchor with the large sheets of
heavy ice passing southward on the tide. The landing was
made about a mile from the house, which was reached by climbing
over the granite cliffs of the shore, at two o’clock on a
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
delightfully calm, clear morning, with the sun well above the
horizon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The station consists of two small houses, that belonging to
Peary being the old deck-house of his ship the <span class='it'>Windward</span>, the
other, a small building with single-boarded sides, in which the
Stein expedition spent two winters. The houses were only a
few yards apart, both about fifty yards from the water, and
surrounded with the usual heaps of old tin cans and empty
boxes found about northern quarters where the staples of food
are carried in cases. A large amount of putrid walrus blubber
was scattered everywhere about the place, and the smell from
it was far stronger than that of a deserted snowhouse in springtime,
which was our previous limit to pungent and disagreeable
odours. On a low rocky hill, a few yards behind the houses,
were the burial-mounds of five Eskimos, four adults and one
child, all wrapped in musk-ox skins and loosely covered with
stones. An old gun, snow knives and other gear belonging to
the dead were placed alongside the graves. These must have
been very pleasant company during the long Arctic night,
especially so close to the scene of the Greely disaster, where
many of that party died of starvation and sickness before relief
could reach them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When one has been at the headquarters of these Arctic expeditions,
a good idea is gained of the difficulties and privations
of those engaging in polar research. Peary was here, over eight
hundred miles in a straight line from the pole, forced to make
many trips to transport his provisions and outfit to the farthest
land before he could attempt his dash across the rough Arctic
pack for the pole. The pluck and daring of such men are to be
admired, but the waste of energy, life and money in a useless
and probably unsuccessful attempt to reach the pole can only
be deplored, as no additional scientific knowledge is likely to
be gained by this achievement.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/046a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_046' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Cape Herschel, Ellesmere Island.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>On our return to the boat, we found that a very large floe
had come between us and the ship, and in doing so a corner of
it had caught on a small island and had gone completely over
it, showing the momentum of these great cakes, and the hopelessness
of the attempt to build a ship sufficiently strong to
withstand the pressure exerted by such ice moving on the tide
when suddenly arrested by land or by motionless ice. A narrow
lane of water still showed between the floe and the land, and by
hard rowing we got safely through before it closed, when the
ship butted the way through other ice and finally took us on
board.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ross bay was now crossed in order that a record might
be left at Cape Herschel on the mainland of the great island of
Ellesmere, Cape Sabine being on an island separated from the
mainland by a narrow strait. When about a mile from Cape
Herschel, going full speed, and while an attempt was made to
pass between two small icebergs, the ship struck heavily on a
sharp point of rock. Luckily she did not hang, but bounced
over it, striking again amidships and finally on the stern post.
A sounding taken within two hundred yards of the rock gave
a depth of seventy fathoms, from which it was concluded that
the rock was a sharp submerged peak, with the icebergs
grounded on two sides of it. The pumps were immediately
sounded, but the ship was found to be making very little water,
and the full extent of the damage was not known until the
vessel was placed in dry-dock at Halifax, when it was found
that the blow in the bow had loosened the iron stemplate, which
was subsequently lost in butting the heavy ice, and the lower
stem was carried away to the ends of the planking. Luckily
the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> is eight feet thick in the bow, and could stand a
great deal of damage there without serious danger to her floating
qualities. Seventy-five feet of the keel was removed by
the second blow and the stern-post twisted and broken by the
third.
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It took little time to attend to the duties of the landing at
Cape Herschel, where a document taking formal possession in
the name of King Edward VII., for the Dominion, was read,
and the Canadian flag was raised and saluted. A copy of the
document was placed in a large cairn built of rock on the end
of the cape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The return to the ship was made at half past six in the morning,
when, steaming southward, the heavy dangerous ice from
Smith sound was soon left behind. We continued southward
all day, passing as close to the land as the ice would allow, so
as to make a chart of this badly surveyed coast. The survey
was carried to a point about fifteen miles to the south of Cape
Isabella, where the weather became foggy, and progress through
the ice was only possible by following leads of open water
running southeast or diagonally away from the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ice met with during the crossing of Smith sound and for
a few miles southward of Cape Sabine was chiefly large masses
of thick Arctic ice, lately brought south by the northern current
from Kennedy channel, where the fast ice appeared to have
broken loose only a short time previous to our arrival, and was
quickly emptying out of the great channel leading direct to the
Arctic sea. All of this ice was solid, and from twenty to forty
feet in thickness, and could not be of the previous winter’s
formation as no ice of that thickness can be formed in one
season. The greater part of it probably had been formed on the
surface of the Arctic ocean, during one or more years’ drift
across the polar regions before it entered the northern part of
Kennedy channel, where it had remained during the past
winter, and was now passing south to mingle with the other ice
of the ‘middle pack’ of Baffin bay. Much of the ice met with
to the southward was composed of large sheets of similar heavy
Arctic ice cemented together by thinner ice of one season’s
formation, evidently drifted out of some bay to the southward
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>
of Cape Sabine. It had quite recently broken away in great
sheets (one of which took three-quarters of an hour to steam
past) from the mouths of the bays whose inner surfaces were
still tightly frozen as we passed them. The diverse character
of these large sheets is further increased by the number of small
icebergs often seen frozen into the mass along with the polar
sea ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eastern side of Ellesmere island is quite high, the probable
general elevation exceeding 2,000 feet and perhaps 3,000
feet. The coast-line is broken by many deep bays and prominent
headlands. The land rises precipitously from the frozen
sea into irregular mountains, whose partly rounded peaks are
as a rule masked by an ice-cap which appears to be continuous
along this eastern coastal region, although it is said not to
continue for any great distance inland. Great glaciers fill all
the valleys and actively discharge icebergs into the bays. Only
the projecting rocky headlands and some of the lower points
facing south in the bays are free of snow and ice, so that at
least nine-tenths of the surface is permanently covered by an
icy mantle. This is in marked contrast to the Greenland coast
opposite, where all the outer cliffs and the shores are comparatively
free from snow and ice. The cause of this marked
difference of climate is probably due to a divergence of direction
of currents along these coasts. On the Greenland side a
southerly current, comparatively free of ice, allows the open sea
to raise the general temperature, while on the Ellesmere side
the Arctic current, with its continuous stream of ice, blocks the
bays and does not allow the open water to ameliorate the cold
of the ice-covered lands. The prevailing easterly winds also
carry more moisture to the west side, causing it to be masked
by fog at the time of brilliant sunshine on the opposite coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The 12th proved thick and dirty, with much rain. Land was
only seen in the early morning, and not again until five o’clock
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>
in the evening, when a number of small islands showed our position
to be off Cape Horsburg, the northeastern point of Philpot
island, on the northern side of the entrance to Lancaster sound;
we had therefore passed across the mouth of Jones sound without
a sight of the land on either side.</p>

<h2>LANCASTER SOUND.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Short glimpses of the land on the north side of Lancaster
sound were obtained when the fog lifted at intervals during the
night. These showed a high country, with many moderately
sharp peaks rising in the foreground above the white mantle
of ice of the great glaciers of the valleys. Discharging glaciers
were particularly numerous along the head of the wide Croker
bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At eight o’clock in the morning we arrived at the mouth of
Cuming creek, a long narrow bay a few miles west of Croker
bay. Being short of fresh water, and the weather promising to
be bad, we proceeded ten miles up the bay before finding a place
sufficiently shallow to drop anchor, but this was finally done on
the edge of a bank formed by the material brought down by a
small river flowing into the head of the bay. We remained at
anchor here until the next evening, the wind during that time
blowing strongly from the eastward, accompanied with thick fog
and occasional flurries of snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crystalline rocks, which occupy the eastern part of the
great island of North Devon, are overlaid by nearly flat-bedded
limestones, in the western part commencing on the west side of
Croker bay. This change of rock is accompanied by a change
in the physical character of the coast as the ragged irregular
granite hills of the eastern land are replaced by a flat tableland
which rises in nearly perpendicular cliffs directly from the sea
to elevations varying from 800 to 1,200 feet. Behind these the
land rises in steps to nearly 2,000 feet, where it is lost beneath
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>
the ice-cap of the interior. The cliffs of limestone have been
deeply sculptured by all the streams of water, great and small,
so that the coast resembles on a gigantic scale the banks of a
stream flowing through a clay country. This portion of the
coast extending to Beechey island at the southwest point of
North Devon, is deeply indented with many long narrow bays
similar to Cuming creek, in which we were anchored. While
there, landings were made to collect plants and fossils, and an
attempt was made to reach the tableland, but proved unsuccessful
owing to the impossibility of scaling the perpendicular cliff
near the summit. The land about the bay was particularly
desolate and barren, the little vegetation found being along the
courses of the small streams. No trace of land animals was
seen. Walruses and seals were observed sporting in the waters
of the bay, and a large colony of Burgomaster gulls pointed to
the presence of fish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The anchor was lifted at eight o’clock on the evening of the
14th, and two hours later we were steaming westward close
under the cliffs in order to make a survey of the coast. This
was completed to Beechey island by eleven o’clock next morning,
when the ship again came to anchor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cliffs to the westward of Cuming creek gradually become
lower, and the crystalline rocks below the limestones soon
disappear beneath the sea. A few small glaciers discharge into
the sea in the neighbourhood of that place, but as the coast is
followed westward the ice-cap retreats inland, and is finally
lost sight of, nothing being left to break the monotony of the
dirty yellow colour of the limestone except a few patches of
struggling vegetation that increase towards the westward where
the climate is evidently milder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As many of the crew as could be spared were allowed to land
at Beechey island to visit this historic spot, where the ill-fated
and heroic Franklin and the crews of the <span class='it'>Erebus</span> and <span class='it'>Terror</span>
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>
spent their last winter on land, and where the headquarters of
the search party was established in subsequent years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beechey island is comparatively small, being only a square
mile or so in extent. It lies at the southwest end of North
Devon, and is connected at low tide by a narrow neck with the
larger island, thus forming the good anchorage of Erebus harbour.
The southern side of the island is a small hill, from three
to four hundred feet high, with steep cliffs facing the water and
less abrupt slopes northward, where it falls to the level of the
low plain of the rest of the island. A flagstaff crowns the
summit of the hill. The lower part of the island rises from the
waters of the harbour in a succession of three or four low
terraces each a few feet above the one in front, and all covered
with small loose limestone shingle, where a few hardy flowers
struggle for existence on the dry barren surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ancient settlement was placed on the edge of the plain,
close to the foot of the hill, and facing eastward. On the shore
are the ice-battered remains of a small sloop, now completely
dismantled, and a large mahogany lifeboat badly broken by the
ice. On the first terrace, a few yards above the high-water
mark, stands the frame of the ancient house, with a low stone
wall along its north and west sides. Inside and between the
walls are many casks of provisions, all of which have been
broken open and the contents spoiled. A small platform cart,
showing few signs of its long exposure to the weather, stood
beside the house, and was brought home as a souvenir. Scattered
in profusion over the terrace and along the shore were the
empty tins of the notorious Goldner’s Patent, which had been
opened, found rotten and condemned by Franklin, thus reducing
his stock of supposed tinned provisions. Old cask staves and
hoops were mingled with hundreds of leather boot soles, evidently
left by some of the relief expeditions.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Franklin Monument at Beechey Island.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the next terrace, a few yards in rear of the house, a
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>
wooden cenotaph surmounted by a round ball and set in a small
platform of cemented limestone was erected to the memory of
Franklin and his heroic associates by one of the subsequent
expeditions, and to-day stands in a fair state of repair. Resting
face-downward on the platform, alongside of the cenotaph, was
a large marble slab, inscribed, as a tribute to the memory of
Franklin and the crews of the <span class='it'>Erebus</span> and <span class='it'>Terror</span>, by citizens
of the United States. A brass plate, affixed to the lower part of
the slab, records that it had been brought from Disko to its
present resting place by McClintock in the <span class='it'>Fox</span>, when he
obtained final proof of the total destruction of Franklin’s ill-fated
party. The slab was raised and photographed, and then
replaced on the ground to avoid the danger of its being broken
by the winds. If another expedition visits this place the
material for a suitable foundation for the slab should be taken,
so that it may be erected as originally intended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the barren plain, a few hundred yards from the house, are
four graves marked by small wooden crosses, the last resting
place of two of Franklin’s crews and two belonging to the search
parties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sealed tin case was found attached to the cenotaph, and on
opening it a record of the Norwegian Magnetic Pole Expedition
was found. The record stated that the <span class='it'>Gjoa</span>, with the
expedition on board, had arrived here in the latter part of
August, 1903, after having picked up the provisions left for
them at Dalrymple island by one of the Scotch whalers, and
were proceeding immediately down Peel sound in order to get
their ship as near as possible to the magnetic pole before the
sound became frozen over. As this was the last tidings from
this expedition the record was taken away, and since our return
has been forwarded to the Norwegian government. The <span class='it'>Gjoa</span>
in which the expedition sailed is a small but stout sloop, with
auxiliary power supplied by a gasolene engine. The only
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>
danger to the party is in event of the <span class='it'>Gjoa</span> being unable to free
herself from the ice when the time comes for a return. As the
expedition is aware of the whaling and police establishments
in the northwestern part of Hudson bay a retreat there may be
made without great difficulty, if accompanied by natives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were forced to leave Beechey island hurriedly, owing to
a large quantity of ice being driven rapidly out of the harbour
by a fresh breeze and a falling tide, which threatened to
separate us from the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the island no ice could be seen to the westward or
northward in Wellington channel and Barrow strait. Our
instructions limited the cruise westward in Lancaster sound to
our present position, and the damaged condition of the ship,
together with a supply of provisions insufficient for another
winter in the ice, all militated against the desire to attempt the
Northwest Passage, which under favourable conditions seemed
possible in our staunch powerful steamship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We left Erebus harbour at half-past two in the afternoon,
standing southward across Lancaster sound for North Somerset
island. At five o’clock some loose stringers of ice were met, and
the course was changed to the eastward to avoid them. The
north wind freshened to a gale accompanied by fog, and trouble
was experienced in making the channel between Leopold island
and Cape Clarence, at the mouth of Prince Regent inlet. The
cape was passed at ten o’clock. The ship then steamed south,
along the high cliffs of limestone, for Port Leopold, where we
arrived at midnight. These cliffs rise 1,000 feet perpendicularly,
being formed of nearly horizontal beds of limestone of
different thicknesses and various shades of yellow, so that the
cliff has a marked horizontal banding. The rocks appear to
have long been submitted to the action of the weather and of
small streams, each of which has cut a more or less marked gully
into the face of the cliff, and the whole, taken together, give the
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>
appearance of vertical fluting, while the weathered tops have a
castellated finish like that of some gigantic fortress. The cliffs
fall away abruptly into a long low point of shingle which partly
closes the mouth of the spacious and safe harbour of Port
Leopold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As we steamed into the harbour what appeared to be an overturned
boat with a wooden ‘lean-to’ built against it was
seen at the end of the low point, with a small Danish flag flying.
The whistle was blown, but no sign of life appeared about the
place, and thinking that the Magnetic Pole expedition might
perhaps have met with some disaster and that the survivors
might be in want, a boat was lowered and the doctor was sent
ashore with stimulants and warm blankets. Happily his services
were not required; the supposed boat proved to be the
boiler of a steam launch, left here by one of the Franklin search
parties. Against it were piled a number of cases of provisions
left a few days previously by the whaler <span class='it'>Windward</span> for the
<span class='it'>Gjoa</span>, and marked by a small flag flying above them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light-coloured limestone forms the bottom of the harbour,
and gives the water a dangerous looking, light tinge, which is
quite misleading, as the depth is sufficient for the largest ships.
The east and west sides of the harbour are bounded by high
cliffs, while at the northern end the land is low, and it is not far
across it to the bay on the northern coast lying directly west of
Cape Clarence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>North Somerset has physical characteristics closely resembling
those of North Devon; the limestone cliffs of the northern
shore, however, appear to be somewhat lower and more broken
than those of the northern island, while the amount of snow
and ice of the land is considerably less. The high perpendicular
cliffs of the east side appear to continue far to the southward
down Prince Regent inlet.
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The wind increased during the night, and blew a gale all
next day, strong and almost continuous gusts from the high hills
sweeping the crests from the waves and rendering a landing
impossible. The wind fell away towards morning. On the 17th
a landing was made on the point, the flag was hoisted and a
copy of the Proclamation and of the Customs Regulations was
left in the boiler. Close alongside lay the wreck of the launch,
destroyed by the ice, only the keel, some of the timbers and
lower planking remaining. Signs of the whalers and of natives
were plentiful on the point, where the circles of stones and fireplaces
marked the tents of the former, and other fireplaces
showed where the whalers had been ‘trying-out’ whale
blubber. A curious sled-runner of teak was picked up on the
beach. It was about six feet long and full of holes bored for
lashing on the shoeing, which was of walrus ivory, and further
secured to the runner by wooden pegs. The wood was either
from the wreck of the launch, or more likely from that of the
<span class='it'>Fury</span>, lost early in last century, some miles to the southward of
Port Leopold, on the western side of Prince Regent inlet. The
evidence of great age in the runner points to the latter origin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Port Leopold was left shortly before noon, and we were soon
tossing in the head sea caused by the past gale. The wind
changed to eastward, and within an hour of leaving the
harbour we were again inclosed in a thick fog, which rendered
a return impossible. The fog lasted until the next evening.
During the interval we steamed cautiously across the mouth of
Prince Regent, Admiralty and Navy Board inlets, and with
clearing weather found ourselves outside the Wollaston islands
that lie a few miles from the northwest corner of Bylot island.
A parting between the lower and upper fog gave a beautiful
ribbon-like picture of the rough snow-covered coast and peaks
of Bylot island flooded with bright sunshine, in marked contrast
to the gloomy, foggy weather about the ship.
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A wide belt of heavy field ice, which was dangerous to enter
in the low fog that obscured the shores, lay along the land; consequently
the impressions of the northern part of the island
were obtained from a distant view between the banks of fog.
The scenery was characteristic of the northern lands occupied
by the crystalline rocks, the principal feature being sharp
rugged peaks upwards of 1,500 feet in height, rising above the
deep glaciers of the valleys and backed by a continuous ice-cap
a few miles inland.</p>

<h2>PONDS  INLET.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>During the night much field-ice and many icebergs were
passed as we steamed along the shores. Next morning at eleven
o’clock, having rounded Cape Graham Moore, we came to an
Eskimo encampment just inside Button point on the north side
of the entrance to Ponds inlet. A landing was made at the
mouth of a small stream, on the clay banks of which were
located thirteen cotton and skin tents of these natives. All the
able-bodied men were away in the whaleboats, either at Erik
harbour, on the south side of the inlet, or some distance up it.
There were a large number of women and children who, with a
few sick men, completely filled a whaleboat in which they
visited the ship in search of food. Many were sick with a
disease resembling typhoid-pneumonia, being troubled by internal
bleeding and a high fever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We secured the services of a very intelligent man as pilot to
the place some miles up the inlet where the Scotch whalers
were anchored. From him we learned that the sloop <span class='it'>Albert</span>
had wintered in Erik harbour, and that two small whales had
been captured by natives in her boats during the early summer.
Continuing our way up the inlet, a second encampment of six
tents was passed about six miles beyond Button point. From
the pilot we learned that the total native population about Ponds
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
inlet comprised thirty-five families, or one hundred and forty-four
persons. The only other band on the northern shores
of Baffin island lived at Admiralty inlet, and does not exceed
forty persons in all. Members of this band annually visit
Ponds inlet to trade for the necessary supplies of ammunition,
knives and other articles to be obtained from the whalers. At
this time over one-half of the population of Ponds inlet were
away inland to the southwest after a supply of deerskins for
winter clothing, and would not return before the snow fell.
The deer country is free from snow during the summer, and
consists partly of rolling country, with a few high hills, but
principally of a plain, cut by many streams and dotted with
numerous lakes, the deer feeding on the grass and shrubs which
are plentiful in the interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylot island is everywhere high and rough, and supports few
deer except in the northeastern interior. The ice-cap, seen
everywhere from the coast, does not extend far inland, where
much of the land is bare in summer. The natives of Ponds
inlet frequently cross to Fox channel and Repulse bay. During
the past winter a party returning from the latter place brought
letters from the whaling station at Repulse bay. They also
occasionally cross to North Somerset, where of late years musk-oxen
have been killed. This journey is at rare intervals continued
across Lancaster sound to North Devon, where many
deer and musk-oxen are found along the western side, while
bears and walrus are plentiful among the ice of Wellington
channel. In the winter all congregate at Button point, where the
early part of the season is spent in houses built half into the
ground, the low walls being made of boulders and whalebones
cemented together with clay and sods, the roof being a portion
of the summer tent. The ordinary snowhouse is used, as in
other places, after the snow falls and until the late spring.
During the winter food is obtained by killing narwhals and
occasional seals and walrus in the open water at the edge of the
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>
solid ice near the mouth of the inlet. The whales come in July
and sport about the mouth of the inlet until the ice breaks up,
when they either follow the solid edge in its retreat up the inlet,
or pass southward along the coast. In former years at least
half of the whales taken by the Scotch whaling fleet were captured
in the vicinity of Ponds inlet.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/058a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_058' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Cliffs Of Bylot Island.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Owing to the northwest trend of the south shore the inlet
gradually narrows as it is ascended, so that about fifteen miles
above Button point, where a high rocky island terminates the
southern point, the distance from shore to shore does not greatly
exceed three miles. Farther westward it again broadens to
twice that distance, and so continues until, turning north, it
bounds the western side of Bylot island, where it is known as
Navy Board inlet. Two long narrow bays pierce deep into the
comparatively flat country of northern Baffin island from the
neighbourhood of the bend, and a very fine salmon river empties
into the more eastern bay. At the time of our visit the western
end of the inlet was still filled with ice, making it impossible
to visit this portion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About ten miles beyond the narrows we came to anchor close
under the steep clay banks of the drift plain on the south side
of the inlet, and alongside the Scotch whalers <span class='it'>Eclipse</span> and
<span class='it'>Diana</span>. Shortly after, we were visited by Captain Milne, Captain
Adams and Mr. Much of the <span class='it'>Albert</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A great deal of valuable information concerning whales and
whaling, as well as about the ice currents and other points relating
to the Arctics, was obtained from these gentlemen, all of
whom have had many years’ experience in these regions. Much
of this information has been used in the article on whaling,
which is printed later in this report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finding that Arctic salmon were plentiful at the mouth of
the little river about a mile from the ships, a small net was
borrowed, and two boats were sent away to secure a supply of
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
fresh fish. They returned loaded in an hour, having made but
four casts of the net, in which over a thousand splendid fish
were taken, varying in weight from three to ten pounds and
aggregating at least 5,000 pounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A strong gale from the eastward blew until the evening of
the 21st, with thick banks of fog covering the hills and filling
the narrows, while the weather about the ships remained fine
and clear. The <span class='it'>Diana</span> broke adrift during the gale and lost an
anchor and thirty fathoms of chain. During our detention
landings were made, and some trips were taken inland over the
high, terraced plain, which extends far to the south and westward.
The lowest terrace is two hundred feet above the sea.
The surface of the plain is uneven, and deeply cut by the valleys
of several small streams. The higher terraces flank the
rocky hills to the eastward, the highest being fully six hundred
feet above sea-level. On the plain and in the valleys there is
considerable Arctic vegetation, from which a very interesting
collection of plants was made by Dr. Borden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of partly underground houses, similar to those
already described, were found at the mouth of a small stream
close to the anchorage. From several ancient graves along
the banks of the stream a short distance from the houses a good
collection of skulls was obtained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the gale abated, we started down the inlet for Erik
harbour, accompanied by the other ships; the narrows once
passed, we had to literally feel our way to the harbour through
the dense fog, and anchored at its head alongside the whalers
<span class='it'>Balaena</span> and <span class='it'>Albert</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A landing was made to collect specimens of the granites and
their associated rocks, which form the hills surrounding the
harbour, and to visit the glacier which fills over two-thirds of
its head. The glacier is a mile wide where it empties into the
harbour, the ice along the front being about a hundred feet
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>
thick. As there is now very little motion to the ice, few icebergs
break off, and those that do are too small to cause danger to
the vessels in the anchorage. The southern corner of the bay is
free of ice, and a small river discharges there from a southern
valley. The glacier comes down the northwest valley, leaving
its rocky wall about a mile inland; thence to the sea it is
bounded by a steep ridge of glacial drift full of large boulders;
the crest of this ridge gradually falls from two hundred feet to
fifty feet as it approaches the water. There are large quantities
of mud on and through the ice, so that all the streams discharging
from it are very dirty. At some former time this glacier
filled the entire valley extending to its mouth five miles away,
and depositing against the rocky walls banks of boulder drift
to a height of four hundred feet above the present level of the
sea. There is no doubt that in the glacial period the size and
extent of the glaciers of Baffin island were much greater than
at present; at the same time the sharp outlines of the hills, together
with the absence of that intense polishing and striation
of the rocks so common in Labrador and more southern regions,
point to a much thinner ice-cap during the glacial period in
these northern regions than on the continental area to the south.
This may be accounted for, in part, by a smaller precipitation
from the narrow, ice-laden seas in the north.</p>

<h2>VOYAGE SOUTHWARD FROM PONDS INLET.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>We left Erik harbour late on the afternoon of the 22nd,
intending to proceed southward along the coast in order to
correct the chart, which we were informed was very unreliable
to Cumberland gulf. The fog closed down shortly after leaving,
and, soon, large sheets of heavy ice forced us to the eastward
away from the land, which was not seen again until we were
within a few miles of the northern side of Cumberland gulf,
on the morning of the 27th. Meanwhile the ship, continuously
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>
battling with heavy floes of northern ice, had been forced nearly
over to the Greenland coast in the endeavour to find a passage
southward, and then had to work back to the western side in
order to visit Cumberland gulf. Continuing in this heavy ice,
which completely filled the gulf, we finally reached Blacklead
island on the 31st, having passed a small Norwegian brigantine
tightly beset in the ice about twenty miles from that place. We
lay alongside this vessel during the night previous, and were
boarded by her captain, who rightly had much fear for the
safety of his small unprotected craft in the heavy pack. All
the supplies for the coming year belonging to the mission and
whaling stations of the gulf were aboard, and if she were
crushed everybody living at those stations would have a hard
time until relief reached them in the summer of 1905. We
took on board the mail and ship’s papers for the stations, and
left her still tight in the ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Blacklead we were visited by the Rev. Mr. J. Peck and the
agent of the whaling station, and learned from them that the
past year had been very unprofitable to the whalers and disastrous
to the natives. Owing to the quantity of broken ice that
had been tightly jammed into the gulf throughout the summer,
and which prevented the boats from reaching the open water,
no whales had been captured, though a few had been seen. A
succession of heavy easterly gales occurred during the winter,
causing a heavy swell, which from time to time broke up the
solid ice of the bay and prevented the natives from going as
usual to the edge of the open water on their winter chase after
seals and walrus; many, consequently, were in a chronic state
of starvation during the winter. The same cause prevented
relief reaching them from the stations, dog-travelling being
impossible. Late in the autumn a heavy gale, in conjunction
with an extra high tide, swept away several tents and other
belongings of the natives who were camped on the lower part
of the island, the tide rising twenty feet above the ordinary
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span>
high-water mark. In March the heavy swell broke up ice three
feet thick, on which forty Eskimos were encamped. During
their retreat to a place of safety three of these people perished
from exposure or were drowned, while many more suffered from
frost-bite and exposure. All the survivors escaped with their
lives only, losing all their belongings on the ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The total returns from the two stations on Cumberland gulf
comprise about three thousand sealskins, twenty tons seal oil,
two walrus skins, one bearskin and a few white-fox skins. The
value of the whole is less than the cost of the provisions consumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A large amount of valuable information concerning the
Eskimo living on the eastern part of Baffin island was obtained
from the Rev. Mr. Peck. It has been used in the preparation
of the article on the Eskimos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of interesting photographs, some of which are reproduced
in this report, were taken on the following day, when
a trip was made to the summit of the island. From that point
the northwestern part of the gulf could be seen blocked with ice
as far as and far beyond Kekerten. The brigantine had
drifted westward with the ice and now lay becalmed in it, about
twelve miles to the northward, with much ice between her and
Blacklead. No special object could be gained by a trip to
Kekerten, and we therefore started, outward bound, early on the
afternoon of the 1st of September. Heavy ice was encountered
all the way to Cape Haven, which was reached on the morning
of the 3rd. The ship was stopped at the small islands about
four miles from the station, owing to the danger of entering
the harbour with so much heavy ice drifting about on the strong
tides. A boat load of natives came off to the ship about an hour
after our arrival, and reported that Captain Jackson had left
with two boats about ten days before on his way to Blacklead in
search of supplies, all the provisions at the station being exhausted,
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>
and no new supply having come for the present year.
No whales had been captured, and the year’s hunt comprised a
few bear and walrus skins. The same complaints were made of
the ice and easterly gales as at Blacklead, and the prospects of
the station looked very dark. The natives said that a letter for
us had been left at the station. A boat was sent for it, but
returned with the information that it was addressed to the captain
of the vessel supposed to be bringing supplies to the station
from Boston.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The heavy Arctic ice, through which the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> had been
constantly battling for the past two weeks, was finally left a
few miles south of Cape Haven, greatly to the relief of everybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the Scotch whaling captains and the people at
the stations, this season was the worst ever known as regards ice
on the coast of Baffin island, and fog and constant southeasterly
gales. The last mentioned account for the prevalence of ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Passing across the mouths of Cyrus Field and Frobisher
bays, and to the eastward of Resolution island, Port Burwell
was again safely reached on the 4th. We remained in the
harbour three days, taking on board coal and provisions previously
landed for the Mounted Police.</p>

<h2>PORT BURWELL TO FULLERTON AND BACK.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Having crossed the mouth of Ungava bay, a strong headwind
greatly delaying the ship, we put into Wakeham bay on the
south side of the strait, to test its capabilities as a harbour. A
fine clear passage was found into the bay on a line from the east
end of Prince of Wales island to the centre of the inlet; there
are a few low shoals on both sides of this line, but all are well
beyond the course. A high, rounded point connected by a sandy
neck to the south side of the bay forms an excellent protected
anchorage just inside the heads. A second anchorage was found
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
about five miles farther up on the same side, opposite to an
Eskimo encampment and close to a good stream of water.
Anchoring at the lower place, we were visited in the evening by
a number of natives from the encampment. Several books,
given for distribution by the Rev. Mr. Peck, were handed out
to them, and they immediately held on deck a service of song
and prayer. These natives had never seen a missionary, but
had learned to read from others at Fort Chimo who had come in
contact with the missionaries on the east coast of Hudson bay.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/064a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_064' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Women’s Boat at Wakeham Bay.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>A pilot, well acquainted with the southern coast of the strait
as far as Cape Wolstenholme, agreed to accompany us to Fullerton
and return again on the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We started early in the morning of the 8th, and passed
through King George sound, reaching Douglas harbour at eight
o’clock, where we were boarded by two natives, each in his kyak,
one of which contained a bear lately killed. A number of walrus
were seen about the small islands a few miles east of Douglas
harbour. Continuing close to the coast, shallow water was
encountered while passing inside of Joy island, a few miles east
of Cape Weggs, where suspiciously low islands fringe the shore.
After considerable difficulty had been experienced in extricating
the ship from this dangerous position, deeper water was
followed to the cape, when the course was laid for Charles
island. While steaming along the island next morning a ship
was seen passing out of the strait, but too far away to signal.
She afterwards proved to be the <span class='it'>Strom</span>, belonging to the French
Fur Company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The walrus, so plentiful last year about the western end of
the island, were now absent; consequently we were unable to
obtain a supply of dog-food for Fullerton. The course was next
directed southward for Deception bay, in the mainland, opposite
the western end of Charles island. When within a few miles of
its mouth the water became shallow and the bottom uneven, so
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>
that the bay could only be approached with safety by sending
the launch ahead to sound. It was thought that too much precious
time would be lost in this undertaking, especially as it
was known that a good harbour existed in the bay, where the
whaler <span class='it'>Arctic</span> had twice anchored, so we passed westward close
to the land in order to correct the survey made during the night
on the trip eastward. About thirty miles west of Deception bay
the mouth of another long narrow inlet, known as Sugluk bay,
was entered, and the ship continued five miles up it looking for
a convenient place for water. A shallow place was crossed at the
mouth of the bay, probably due to the ship being too close to
the eastern shore, but, inside, the water was found to be very
deep, and an anchorage could only be obtained on the edge of
the narrow mud banks close under the rocky cliffs of both
shores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the small launch, the survey of the bay was continued to
its head, some five miles beyond, where the ship anchored. At
the head of the bay three families of natives were found, living
in a state of destitution. This was their first direct contact
with white men; they were somewhat shy and frightened, but
a present of tobacco and biscuit soon made all good friends.
These people do not visit any of the far away trading posts, but
trade their furs with their neighbours on the east or west for
guns and other articles of civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considerable difficulty was experienced returning against a
very strong tide, and the ship was not reached until long after
dark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following afternoon the remainder of the south coast was
surveyed to Cape Wolstenholme, where we arrived at dark;
then the ship was headed north across the strait for Salisbury
island, the eastern end of which was reached early next morning.
Following close along the steep rocky shores of the
northern side, the northeast point was reached at noon. The
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>
weather throughout the morning had been bad, a strong northwest
breeze bringing down frequent heavy blinding showers of
snow. These showers became almost continuous, and towards
noon only momentary glimpses of the land were to be obtained
at long intervals. The tides here are very swift, and when the
sky cleared a strong ice-glint was to be seen ahead. It was
considered dangerous to attempt to enter the ice in such
weather, with the unknown Mill islands directly in the course;
we therefore turned back to pass south of Nottingham island.
This decision proved wise, for next day the whole mouth of Fox
channel was found completely filled with heavy ice drifted
south from the northern parts of that channel. The condition
of the <span class='it'>Neptune’s</span> stem did not warrant any contact with the ice
that could possibly be avoided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The northern side of Salisbury island rises directly from the
water in granite cliffs to elevations varying from 500 to 1,000
feet. The surface of the island appears to be very rugged and
barren. As a rule the shores are without harbours along this
side, but at both ends there are deep bays protected by rocky
islands, where safe harbours would be found if the water did
not prove too deep. In all of the many soundings taken along
the island, no bottom was obtained at two hundred and twenty
fathoms; this is consequently the deepest water in Hudson bay
and strait. Two large icebergs were grounded off the eastern
end of the island, while a third very large one had penetrated
to the head of the bay at the northeastern end and was aground
close under the rocks. As these bergs must have come from
Davis strait, there being no glaciers on the lands fronting on
Hudson bay, they show a strong current from the eastward
along the northern side of the strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 13th, having rounded Salisbury and Nottingham during
the night, ice was met with at nine in the morning, twenty-five
miles to the westward of the last mentioned island. The
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>
course was changed to south of west to skirt the edge of this
great pack, and as it continued unbroken to the westward, the
idea of passing through Fisher strait was abandoned, and the
course was laid to the southward of Coats island. The passage
was encumbered by ice until dark, when the ship lay-to awaiting
daylight. The low southern shore of Coats was then
followed westward to Cape Southampton, after which we headed
away direct for Fullerton. When within a few miles of that
place, on the evening of the 15th, we came up with the Scotch
whaler <span class='it'>Active</span>, now bound homeward from Repulse bay. Captain
Murray came on board, seeking the doctor. From him we
learned that the <span class='it'>Active</span> had passed us, on our way out, on the
20th of July, when leaving the eastern entrance to Evans strait.
She had come in early in the month, and after landing a number
of miners at Lake harbour, on the north side of the strait close
to the eastern end of Big island, had taken on board a large
number of Eskimos from that place and from the vicinity of
Kings cape, at the entrance to Fox channel. Great difficulty
had been experienced in the ice while crossing Fox channel.
Subsequently, little ice was met with until the ship reached
Repulse bay, which was still solidly frozen, so that the <span class='it'>Active</span>
did not get into the harbour there until the 10th of August.
Frozen strait remained full of ice all the season. The <span class='it'>Active</span>
and the whaling station in connection with it at Repulse bay
both had a successful season. The catch of the steamer included
thirty-three white whales, thirty-six walrus, and one Right
whale affording 1,300 pounds of bone. The returns of the
station were twenty-eight musk-ox skins, thirty white whales,
and one small Right whale with 500 pounds of bone. In 1903
the combined catch included five Right whales with a total of
40,000 pounds of bone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Active</span> on her way out would pass through Fisher strait,
in order to hunt walrus at Walrus island and on the floating ice
on the eastern side of Fox channel. Part of the large crew of
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
natives would be put ashore at Kings cape and the remainder
at the mica mine, where the results of the season’s mining, some
thirteen tons, would be taken on board, together with the white
men there, and the ship would leave for home about the 1st of
October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Era</span> had been met in Repulse bay, and had at that time
not added to her catch since we left Fullerton. Captain Comer
was again to winter in Fullerton harbour, and was on his way
south to go into winter quarters. Including the crew, the
<span class='it'>Active</span> had one hundred and twenty-three persons on board;
the ship is quite small, and the accommodation and crowding
can be imagined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fullerton was reached next morning, and we were soon
boarded by the police detachment and our old Eskimo friends
of the past winter. During our absence Staff-Sergeant Dee had
made an exciting trip to Repulse bay in a whaleboat manned by
natives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The day after our arrival the <span class='it'>Era</span> entered the harbour, and
Captain Comer reported the lack of success mentioned above.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We remained at Fullerton until the 25th, being busily employed
in the meantime with landing provisions and coals for
the police, shifting coal, and taking aboard ballast. Two of the
policemen who had been left here in the spring were found to
be seriously ill, and on the doctor’s certificate were taken on
board invalided home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The homeward voyage from Fullerton to Port Burwell was
made in fine weather, and the only incident requiring mention
was that the ice from Fox channel had advanced southward and
westward nearly twenty miles since we last saw it. This necessitated
our keeping close to Mansfield island. Our pilot was
safely returned to his home in Wakeham bay, and Port Burwell
was reached on the 1st of October.
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The ship had not been at anchor in the harbour for an hour,
when the <span class='it'>Arctic</span>, with Major Moodie and Captain Bernier, came
in. Major Moodie brought the welcome word of recall to the
<span class='it'>Neptune</span>, and after procuring some articles of equipment from
us left again that evening, being in a great hurry to reach Fullerton
before the harbour froze over.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A heavy gale of southeast wind kept us in the harbour until
the morning of the 4th, when we rounded Cape Chidley and
turned south bound for home. A fine passage was made down
the Labrador coast, and on the evening of the 7th we reached
Chateau, where telegrams were sent announcing our safe
arrival. The trip across the Gulf of St. Lawrence and along
the coast of Nova Scotia was rough. We arrived in Halifax on
the 12th, looking somewhat weather-beaten, as was only natural
after nearly fifteen months’ absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I cannot close this narrative without expressing the deep
feelings of gratitude I bear towards Captain Bartlett and the
officers and crew of the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>, for their unfailing and cheerful
attention to duty throughout the voyage, an attention which
rendered my leadership both easy and enjoyable.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AN HISTORICAL SUMMARY OF THE DISCOVERIES AND EXPLORATIONS IN ARCTIC AMERICA.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>A summary of Arctic explorations must be confined to a brief
statement of the objects and achievements of the various expeditions,
and in consequence loses the charm of the matter of fact
manner in which the dangers, difficulties and hardships are
recorded in the different narratives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The history of the exploration of the American Arctics opens
with the first voyage of Sir Martin Frobisher, in 1576, and
practically closes with the return of Sverdrup in the <span class='it'>Fram</span>, in
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
1902. The great land masses of the Arctic islands have now
been outlined, and all that remains to be done is to fill in minor
details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The acquirement by Spain of all the richer parts of America
followed close on the discovery of Columbus; at the same time
Portugal laid claim to the southern route, by the Cape of Good
Hope, to India and China, in consequence of the discoveries of
Vasco da Gama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>England was thus debarred from these new fields of wealth,
and it was the search for a northern and unclaimed passage to
the East which stimulated, in the reign of Elizabeth, the
awakening enterprise of London and Bristol merchants to outfit
expeditions under brave and adventurous seamen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first attempt was made to the eastward, around the
northern coasts of Europe and Asia. Although failing in the
main object, a large and profitable trade was opened with
northern Russia, which led to the founding, by Sebastian Cabot,
of the Muscovy Company of London in 1553.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This company, through selfish motives, was unfavourable to
the prosecution of a search for a northern passage to the westward,
and nothing was attempted in that direction until 1576.
In that year Sir Martin Frobisher, filled with enthusiasm by
accounts of a mythical Strait of Anian, which was said to afford
a safe passage between the Atlantic and Pacific, through the
north temperate regions of America, resolved to explore the
strait. Aided by powerful friends, he overcame the opposition
of the Muscovy Company, and under the direct patronage of the
Queen, he succeeded in outfitting three small clumsy vessels,
two being of twenty-five tons burden each, the third being a
pinnace of ten tons. These he provisioned for twelve months,
and with the combined crews, numbering thirty-five persons,
sailed from the Thames. High pinnacle land, covered with
snow, was seen on the 11th of July, in N. latitude 61°. Off
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
this land the pinnace foundered with all on board, and his other
consort, deserting, returned to England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Continuing westward alone, in a leaky ship with a sprung
mast, high land was again seen on the 28th of July. Frobisher
named this land Queen Elizabeths Foreland, but it was not
until the 10th of August that a landing was effected. The following
day, in N. latitude 63°, he entered the bay which bears
his name, thus being the first to reach the great island of Baffin.
He sailed a considerable distance up the bay, believing the
land on his right hand to be the coast of Asia, while that to
the left was the continent of America. The land on the north
side of the entrance to the bay he named the North Foreland,
while Queen Elizabeths Foreland forms the southern point.
While in the bay four of the crew landed without permission,
and were never seen again; in revenge for their supposed
murder by the Eskimos, one of the latter was seized and carried
to England, where he died shortly after arriving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his return to England, Frobisher was greatly commended
for his voyage, especially for the hope he brought of a safe passage
to China, and the Queen named the lands bounding the
supposed strait, Meta Incognita.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A piece of ‘black earth’ picked up on Hall island was submitted
to an alchemist, Baptista Angello, who ‘by coaxing
nature’ obtained some gold from it, or said he did. On the
strength of this discovery, money was immediately raised for a
second expedition, with the sole purpose of bringing back ore.
Three ships were again sent out under Frobisher, and returned
well laden with the supposed ore. During the stay of the expedition
in Frobisher bay several skirmishes took place with the
natives, a number of whom were killed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifteen ships were fitted out in 1578 for the third voyage, to
bring home ore. Carried southward by strong currents, the
fleet entered what was later called Hudson strait, and sailed
several days westward through it before the mistake was discovered.
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>
If Frobisher had been on a voyage of discovery he
might easily have entered Hudson bay, but the search for gold
being the object he turned back, and entered Frobisher bay by
passing through the strait to the east of Resolution island. On
the 1st of August most of the fleet was assembled at the
Countess of Warwick island, where the ore was mined, and all
the ships loaded by the end of the month. The ore finally proving
worthless, nothing further was done to continue the
discoveries of Frobisher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten years after the last voyage merchants of London determined
to fit out another expedition to search for the northwest
passage. The enterprise was entrusted to John Davis, ‘a man
well-grounded in the art of navigation.’ Two vessels, the
<span class='it'>Sunshine</span> and the <span class='it'>Moonshine</span>, were employed for the first voyage,
with a combined crew of forty-two persons. Davis, on his
outward voyage, landed on the southern coast of Greenland, and
named the coast the Land of Desolation. One fiord in latitude
64° 15´, where the mission stations of Godhaab and Nye Hernhut
are located, he named Gilbert’s Sound. Leaving here,
Davis stood to the westward and northward for five days, and
on the 6th of August, 1585, discovered land in latitude 66° 40´,
quite free from ice. He anchored in the mouth of Exeter sound
under Mount Raleigh, calling the north foreland Dier’s cape
and the southern one Cape Walsingham. From here he coasted
southward along the land, and rounded the Cape of Gods Mercy
into Cumberland gulf, up which he sailed for sixty leagues to
some islands. On his return he discovered that Cumberland
gulf was separated from another long inlet, which, not recognizing
as Frobishers bay, he called Lumlie’s inlet. Having crossed
the mouth of this inlet, Davis then crossed to the south side of
another great inlet, and renamed its northern point Warwick’s
Foreland, while the south cape was named after John Chidley.
Davis remarks on the strong tides met with in the entrance to
Hudson strait.
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>On his second voyage Davis coasted the American shore from
the 67th to the 57th degree of latitude, but added nothing to
his previous discoveries to the northward of Hudson strait.
Keeping near the Greenland coast, on his way northward, Davis
on his third voyage reached latitude 72° 15´. The northern
coast of Greenland he called the London coast. Leaving this,
he sailed west for forty leagues, where he fell in with the ice of
the ‘middle pack’ of the whalers; a strong gale then forced him
south along the edge of the ice, so that no land was seen either
to the west or north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>George Weymouth was the next adventurer to seek the northwest
passage. He was fitted out by the Muscovy Company in
1602. On the 28th of June, in the <span class='it'>Discovery</span>, he reached
Warwicks island, between Frobisher and Cumberland bays,
and sailing northward he passed Cape Walsingham and nearly
reached the 69th parallel, when the crew mutinied and forced
him to return south. Passing around Hatton headland on
Resolution island, he sailed a considerable distance up Hudson
strait, and then returned to England, where he arrived on the
5th of August.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain John Knight, in the <span class='it'>Hopewell</span>, sailed in 1606, but
the voyage terminated speedily and disastrously by the death of
Knight, his mate and three of the crew, who were surprised and
slain by the Eskimos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Undeterred by these unsuccessful attempts, Sir John Wolstenholme
and Sir Dudley Digges, in 1610, resolved to employ
the <span class='it'>Discovery</span>, of fifty-five tons, in searching for the northwest
passage, and nominated Henry Hudson to the command. He
had proved his worth on previous voyages to Spitzbergen and
to the Hudson river. On this, the last of his voyages, he first
sighted the south shores of Greenland; eleven days later he
entered Frobisher bay, but was soon turned back by ice, and so
passed south into Hudson strait, which he followed westward
into Ungava bay, where he was greatly obstructed by ice. Passing
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
Akpatok island, which he named Desire Provoketh, on the
11th of July, he reached the islands of Gods Mercies, and thence
sailed along the south shore of the strait, naming it Magna
Britannia. He passed into Hudson bay on the 2nd of August,
through a strait about two leagues broad. The southern head
of this was named Cape Wolstenholme and the northern one, on
an island, Cape Digges; a bold headland six leagues to the
northward was called Salisburies Foreland (Salisbury island).
Hudson’s journal ends on the 3rd of August, and the remainder
of the melancholy story is told by Abacuk Pricket, who states
that they were frozen in, on the 10th of November, in the southeast
part of the bay, after sailing three months through a
labyrinth of islands. Dissensions had early sprung up among
the crew, and in the June following a mutiny broke out headed
by Robert Juet and Henry Greene. On the 21st Hudson was
seized by the conspirators, and, with his young son, forced into
a small boat. The carpenter, John King, accompanied him
voluntarily, while six sick men were also forced into the boat,
which was cut adrift, never to be heard of again. On the way
home Juet and other of the leading mutineers were killed by the
Eskimos at Cape Digges, and the remainder only reached England
after great sufferings from famine and other hardships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1612, Sir Thomas Button, accompanied by Bylot and
Pricket of Hudson’s crew, entered Hudson strait through the
channel between Cape Chidley and Button islands. Having
passed the strait, he continued westward, passing the south end
of Coats island, which he named Cary’s Swan’s Nest, and
reached the western side of the bay, to the northward of Chesterfield
inlet, where he named the land ‘Hopes Checked,’ because
his progress westward was thus arrested. Turning south, he
followed the coast to the mouth of the Nelson river, where he
wintered. His crew suffered greatly from scurvy, but an
abundant supply of birds and fish in the spring recruited the
strength of the men sufficiently to allow them to continue the
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>
voyage. This is memorable as the first instance of a crew wintering
in the north and being sufficiently healthy to remain the
following summer. This year’s voyage ended in latitude 65°,
near Whale point in Roes Welcome. On the homeward voyage
Button passed close to a large island south of Southampton,
which he called Mansell, and not Mansfield, as it is now
written.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following extract from Prince Henry’s instructions for
Button, dated 5th of April, 1612, shows the accurate knowledge
of Hudson strait possessed at that early date: 8. ‘Being in;
we holde it best for you to keep the northern side, as most free
from the pester of ice, at least till you be past Cape Henry;
from thence follow the leading ice, between King James and
Queen Anne’s Foreland, the distance of which two capes observe
if you can, and what harbour or rode is near them, but yet make
all the haste you maie to Salisbury island, between which and
the northerne continent you are like to meet a great hollowe
billowe from an opening and flowing sea from thence.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same year, James Hall and William Baffin went to the
west coast of Greenland in search of a gold mine, at Cunningham
fiord near the Arctic circle, which was reported to have
been worked by the Danes. No ore was found, but traces of old
workings were discovered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baffin, accompanied by Bylot, sailed through Hudson strait
in 1615. He then passed north by Mill island and traced the
northeast shore of Southampton island, from Sea-horse point to
Cape Comfort, the last being according to his observations in
latitude 65° N., longitude 85° 22´ W. Doubling this cape, the
tide was found to set differently from what had been expected,
and gave no hope of a passage in that direction, so he turned
back. The following extract from Baffin’s journal gives his
opinion as to the possibility of a passage westward being found
leading from any of the channels entering Hudson bay:—‘And
now it may be that some expect that I should give my opinion
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
concerning the passadge. To those my answere must be, that
doubtless there is a passadge. But within this strayte, whome
is called Hudson’s straytes, I am doubtfull supposinge the contrarye.
But whether there be or no, I will not affirme. But
this I will affirme, that we have not been in any tyde than that
from Resolutyon Iland, and the greatest indraft of that cometh
from Davis’ straytes; and my judgment is, if any passadge
within Resoluyton Iland, it is but som creeke or inlett, but the
maine will be up <span class='it'>fretum Davis</span>.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>In accordance with this opinion, in 1616, Baffin sailed up
Davis strait, his instructions being to reach if possible the 80th
parallel before turning westward. By following the Greenland
coast he was able to reach Horn sound in latitude 74° before
being greatly embarrassed by ice. Here he met a band of
Eskimos, with whom he traded for narwhal horns and walrus
teeth. Being liberated from Horn sound, Baffin continued
northward past Cape Digges, in latitude 76° 35´, and across the
entrance of Wolstenholme sound to Whale sound, where he was
again beset in the ice during a gale. After being released, he
passed Hakluyt island and reached the offing of a great sound
extending northward of the 78th parallel of latitude; this he
named after Sir Thomas Smith. This was the northern limit
of the voyage. He now turned south, passing Cary islands, and
on the 10th of July anchored at the mouth of Alderman Jones
sound, where a great number of walrus were seen, but no
natives. On the 12th Sir James Lancaster sound was discovered,
but could not be entered on account of the ice across its
mouth. Baffin could not penetrate these sounds owing to the
strong westerly winds blowing out of them. Finding the ‘middle
pack’ immediately south of Lancaster sound, thickly
jammed on the western shore, Baffin stood across to the Greenland
coast, in more open water, and so returned home. In his
report Baffin says that after having coasted nearly all the way
round, he considers it nothing but a great bay, and draws
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>
attention to the importance of the whale fishery, which soon
after was begun, and lasts to the present day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About this time a Danish expedition, under the command of
Jens Munck, sailed into Hudson bay and wintered in the mouth
of Churchill river. The ships were unprepared for a winter in
the north, and, consequently, the crew suffered terribly from
the ravages of scurvy, so that in the spring, out of fifty-two persons
only Munck and two others survived. These fortunately
procured some grasses from under the snow, and as the water
opened killed ducks and fish enough to give them strength to
repair the smaller vessel, in which they reached home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Muscovy Company, in 1631, again decided to send out
an expedition to search for a passage from Hudson bay, and
entrusted the command to Captain Luke Fox. Having passed
through Hudson strait he landed at Cary’s Swan Nest, and then
rounded the southwest point of Southampton island, and proceeded
to explore the channel between that island and the mainland,
up to latitude 64° 10´, where he saw an island near the
mainland, which he named Sir Thomas Roe’s Welcome, a name
now applied to the channel as a whole. Fox’s instructions limited
him to the coast south of latitude 63°, so he now stood to
the south along the shore, passing Marble island, which he called
Brooke Cobham, and the mouth of the Churchill river, and
reaching Nelson river on the 10th of August. Keeping a southerly
course for a fortnight longer, he fell in with Captain James
near Cape Henrietta Maria. Having convinced himself that
there was no opening to the west between latitudes 65° 30´ and
55° 10´, Fox turned northward and explored Fox channel to
the east of Southampton island, naming the prominent points
on the west side of Baffin island, King Charles his Promontory,
Cape Maria, Lord Weston’s Portland and Point Peregrine, the
last being the most northerly point reached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain James was in command of a rival expedition, fitted
out the same year, with instructions to explore to the south of
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>
the track taken by Fox. After parting with Fox, he sailed
southward along the west coast, thoroughly examined it, and
after several narrow escapes from shipwreck through grounding
on shoals, finally ran his ship aground on Charleton island, and
there passed the winter. James gives a woeful tale of the hardships
caused by cold, lack of food and scurvy. He states that
the cold was so intense that wine, sack, oil, vinegar and even
brandy froze solid; that the cook soaked his salt meat near the
fire to prevent it from freezing, and that the side near the fire
was found to be warm while the opposite side was frozen an
inch thick. This is a sample of James’ report, and shows what
reliance may be placed on his other statements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the time of Charles I. to that of George I. England
was convulsed with civil war and revolutions, and was at war
with other nations abroad, so that for nearly a century after
Fox no maritime discoveries were undertaken, and nothing
would have been done in the north but for the foundation of the
Hudson’s Bay Company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two French Canadian fur traders, named Radisson and
Chouart <span class='it'>dit</span> Groseilliers, had for a number of years traded and
lived with the Indians in the country north and west of Lake
Superior, learning much about the great sea to the north, and
the canoe routes leading to it. They visited its southern shores
in 1659, and on their return to Quebec endeavoured to enlist
prominent merchants there in a scheme to establish permanent
trading posts on the bay, to be supplied by ships from Canada
or France. Being unsuccessful, they crossed to Paris, where
they found no one to advance the capital necessary to start the
project. The English ambassador, hearing of their scheme, sent
them to London, where they interested Prince Rupert and
several influential men of the court and city.<a id='r1_1'/><a href='#f1_1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>*</span></sup></a>  These advanced
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
sufficient money to outfit a small vessel, under the command of
Zachariah Gillam, a New England captain, who, accompanied
by Groseilliers and Radisson, sailed through Hudson strait and
down the bay to the mouth of Rupert river. Here friendly
intercourse was held with the natives, and a small fort was
built, in which the party successfully wintered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the return of Gillam, in 1669, Prince Rupert and his
associates applied to Charles II. for a charter. This was granted
on the 2nd of May, 1670, to the Governor and Company of
Adventurers trading from England to Hudson bay. It states
that</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘in consideration of their having at their own cost and
charges undertaken an expedition to Hudson bay in the northeast
parts of America, for the discovery of a new passage to the
South sea, and for the finding of some trade for furs, minerals
and other considerable commodities, and of their already having
made by such their undertakings such discoveries as did encourage
them to proceed farther in pursuance of the said design,
by means whereof there might probably arise great advantage
to the King and his Kingdom, absolutely ceded and gave up to
the said undertakers, the whole trade and commerce of all those
creeks, seas, straits, bays, rivers, lakes and sounds, in what latitude
soever they may be, which are situated within the entrance
of the Hudson’s straits, together with all the countries, lands
and territories upon the coasts and confines of the said seas, &amp;c.,
so that they alone should have the right of trading thither, and
whoever should infringe this right, and be found selling or buying
within the said boundaries, should be arrested and all his
or their merchandises should become forfeit and confiscated,
so that one-half thereof should belong to the King and the other
half to the Hudson’s Bay Company.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In 1670 the newly formed company sent out Charles Bayly,
as Governor, to establish Fort Rupert at the mouth of Rupert
river, in latitude 51° 30´, thus establishing their sovereignty by
right of the first permanent habitation of the territory granted
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>
to them by the King, whose right was that of discovery by
Hudson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French soon felt the competition of the English trading
posts on Hudson bay, and sought to oust them, claiming the
territory about Hudson bay by right of discovery and possession.
They claimed that in 1656 the Sovereign Council of
Quebec authorized Jean Bourdon to make discoveries in Hudson
bay, and that he proceeded there, took possession in the
name of the King of France, and made treaties of alliance with
the natives. This claim is disproved by the journal of the
Jesuits for that year, which relates that Bourdon sailed on the
2nd of May, and returned on the 11th of August, having been
stopped by ice on the coast of Labrador, where a Huron Indian
was killed by the Eskimos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Governor of Canada, D’Argenson, in 1661, despatched
Dablon, a Jesuit missionary, accompanied by Druillette de
Vallière, to the country about Hudson bay. They travelled by
way of the Saguenay, but did not reach the watershed, their
guides refusing to proceed on account of Iroquois war parties
being between them and Hudson bay. The ravages of
the Iroquois were such that no travel was possible in the north
until 1663, when Sieur de la Couture with five men, it is
claimed, proceeded overland to the bay, took possession of the
territory in the name of the King of France, noted the latitude,
planted a cross, and deposited His Majesty’s arms engraved
on copper at the foot of a large tree.   Sieur Duquet and Jean
L’Anglois are said to have visited the bay the same year, by
order of D’Argenson, and to have there set up the King’s arms.
No mention of these important expeditions occurs in the <span class='it'>Relations
des Jésuites</span>. The first Frenchman whose visit to the bay
is undisputed, was the missionary Albanel, who crossed by way
of the Saguenay and Rupert rivers, arriving at the mouth of
the latter on the 28th of June, 1672, where he found a small
fort and a boat belonging to the English traders.
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hudson’s Bay Company, always energetic in establishing
trading posts wherever the Indians congregated about the
shores of the bay, had, by 1685, small forts at the mouths of the
Albany, Moose, Rupert, Eastmain, Severn and Nelson rivers.
All were trading posts except Eastmain, where a mica mine
was worked for a few years, but finally abandoned as unprofitable.
No attempts were made to carry the trade inland in
direct competition with the French, whose <span class='it'>coureurs de bois</span> the
English appear to have held in great respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many complaints were soon made to the Governor of Canada
by merchants and missionaries that the English posts on the bay
were ruining the fur trade and demoralizing the natives; and
he, knowing no affront in this quarter would cause James II.
to break with Louis XIV., resolved, in a time of peace, to take
possession of the English forts. The Governor accordingly sent
a detachment of soldiers, under the command of Chevalier de
Troyes, overland from Quebec, who, almost without a struggle,
took possession of Rupert, Moose and Albany forts. This was
the commencement of an intermittent warfare between French
and English on Hudson bay, lasting until the treaty of Utrecht,
in 1713. In 1690 D’Iberville sailed from Quebec with two ships
to capture Fort Nelson, but was unsuccessful. War having been
declared between England and France in 1693, the Company,
assisted by warships, retook Albany, Moose and Rupert forts.
The following year D’Iberville, with two ships and one hundred
and twenty men, took Fort Nelson from the English; while a
strong force, sent overland from Canada, easily recaptured
Albany and Rupert forts. These latter places were a second
time recovered by the assistance of the warships <span class='it'>Bonaventure</span>
and <span class='it'>Seaford</span>, in 1695: while in the following summer Fort Nelson
was recovered with the aid of four warships.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1697 D’Iberville again visited the bay, where he destroyed
the English ships amongst the ice, and afterwards took Nelson,
renaming it Fort Bourbon. By the treaty of Ryswick, signed
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
in this year, each country returned to the other all places taken
during the war, and retained those captured previously, thus
leaving to the company the possession of Albany only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Affairs remained in this condition until the treaty of Utrecht,
in 1713, when the French relinquished all claims to the territory
about Hudson bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first attempt at exploration inland was made by the
Hudson’s Bay Company, in 1691, when Henry Kelsey, by order
of the Governor at Nelson, accompanied some Indians to the
interior. From his diary, it would appear that he journeyed,
in a canoe, some distance up the Nelson river, and then tramped
overland to the open country north of the Saskatchewan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1719, the Company made extensive preparations for an
exploration of the northern parts of Hudson bay. The expedition
consisted of a frigate, commanded by Captain Vaughan,
and a sloop by Captain Barlow, the chief command being entrusted
to Captain James Knight, who had been governor of a
number of the forts, but who was eighty years of age. The
expedition sailed from England in June, well stored with provisions,
with a house in frame and a large stock of goods for
trade. Their instructions were to proceed to the northward, by
Sir Thomas Roe’s Welcome, as far as 64° latitude, in search of
the Anian strait. As the ships did not return to England in
1720, fears were entertained for their safety, and orders were
despatched by the next ship to send the <span class='it'>Whalebone</span>, John
Scroggs, master, in search of them. The instructions reached
Churchill too late to be acted upon that season, and Scroggs did
not sail until 1722. After considerable trouble with shallow
water and shoals along the coast, he managed to reach Marble
island, where pieces of wreck were found, but they were considered
of no importance by Scroggs, who returned without
continuing the search. Hopes were long entertained that
Knight had made his way to the Pacific, and it was not until
1767 that the fate of the expedition became known. That year
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
the Company started a whale fishery at Marble island, and one
of the boats engaged in the fishery accidently discovered a harbour
near the east end of the island; at its head guns, anchors,
cables and many other articles were found. The wrecks of the
ships lay in five fathoms of water, and the remains of the house
were still in existence, with two skulls on the ground near by.
Hearne learned from the Eskimos that the ships arrived late in
the summer, that the larger one received much damage entering
the harbour, that soon after arriving the house was built and
that the white men numbered about fifty. When the natives
again visited them, during the following summer, their number
was greatly reduced, and the remainder were unhealthy. The
carpenters were then at work on a boat. By the beginning of
winter the number was reduced to twenty, and in the following
summer only five remained alive, all of whom died within a
few days after the arrival of the natives. That such a disaster
could occur within two hundred and fifty miles of Churchill is
astonishing at the present day, when so much more is known
of the comparative ease with which long journeys may be made
over the snow and ice in the springtime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this disastrous termination of their first expedition by
sea, the Company was not eager to undertake another, but they
were practically forced to do so by Arthur Dobbs, a zealous and
enthusiastic advocate of the northwest passage. On his insistence,
two sloops were sent northward from Churchill, in 1737,
to open trade with the natives, and to look for a northern passage
to the westward; the latter seems never to have been
seriously undertaken, and did not at all satisfy Dobbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1741, Captain Middleton, who had been long in the service
of the Hudson’s Bay Company, was selected by the Admiralty
to conduct an expedition of discovery up the Welcome. He
sailed with two small vessels, and wintered at Churchill. The
following summer he proceeded northward, and discovered
Wager inlet and Repulse bay, the south headland of which he
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>
named Cape Hope. Being unable to proceed farther on account
of ice, he walked fifteen miles to a high point, from which he
saw a frozen strait, turning round the north end of Southampton
island, with the flood tide coming from Fox channel into
Repulse bay. On Middleton’s return, Dobbs was greatly disappointed,
and preferred charges against Middleton to the
Admiralty, accusing him of want of honesty in the report of his
proceedings, and of concealing everything that told in favour
of a passage, so that he might serve the interests of the Hudson’s
Bay Company, which he, Dobbs, alleged would be injured by the
discovery of a northwest passage. The honest reply of Middleton
and the evidences which he adduced of the truth of his statements
satisfied the Admiralty, but it was not until eighty years
later that the correctness of his statements was verified by
Parry. In the meantime Dobbs had influence enough to procure
the passage of an Act of Parliament, offering a reward of
£20,000 for the discovery of a northwest passage; and was also
instrumental in raising sufficient money to outfit two ships to
earn the reward. They sailed in 1746, and wintered at Port
Nelson. Their captains agreed only on one point, and that was
that they were not expected to explore Repulse bay and the
Frozen strait, and, after an examination, that Wager inlet could
connect only with the Welcome. On the 25th of August a council
was held, and a ‘definitive resolution was taken to bear away
without further delay for England’—‘the discovery being
finished,’ as the narrative puts it. Both ships had entered Chesterfield
inlet, which had been examined as far as an overfall or
cascade. The account of this was not thought satisfactory in
England, so, to settle the question the Hudson’s Bay Company
sent Captain Christopher in a sloop to examine it again, in
1761. On his return he reported that he had navigated the inlet
for more than 150 miles in a westerly direction, until he found
the water fresh, but had not seen its end. On this, Mr. Norton
was sent, in 1762, to trace it to its extremity, which he did, and
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>
found it to end at a distance of 170 miles from its entrance,
in a fresh water lake seventy-two miles in length, and from
twenty to twenty-five miles wide. In 1791 Captain Duncan
examined, for the Hudson’s Bay Company, Corbets or Rankin
inlet, which proved to be a bay, and Chesterfield inlet, which he
found to agree with Norton’s description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Samuel Hearne, a clerk in the service of the Hudson’s Bay
Company, started, in 1770, with a party of Chipeweyan
Indians, and travelled overland on foot to the mouth of the
Coppermine river, where the Indians massacred a number of
Eskimos. On his return journey he passed Great Slave lake,
and reached Fort Churchill in safety after one of the most
remarkable journeys ever accomplished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ended for many years the attempts of the Hudson’s Bay
Company at northern exploration, their undivided energies
being required to maintain the trade struggle with their energetic
rivals, the North-west Company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Previous to the conquest of Canada, the French fur traders
had carried their trading posts beyond the great lakes, across
the wooded country to Lake Winnipeg, and thence up the
Saskatchewan to the foot of the Rocky mountains. Shortly
after the cession, a number of Scotch and Canadian merchants
acquired the rights of the old French company, and prosecuted
the trade with such increased vigour as to greatly diminish that
of the Hudson’s Bay Company, who in self-defence were compelled
to establish trading posts inland close to those of their
rivals. In this manner the interior of British America was soon
dotted with trading stations that extended over the whole
territory from the bleak shores of the Atlantic to and beyond
the Rocky mountains. The strong rivalry for furs soon led
to collisions between the partizans of both companies, and blood
was often shed; the natives were debauched with liquor, and
general lawlessness continued until the amalgamation of the
companies in 1820.
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The wars with the American colonies and with France occupied
the undivided attention of the British nation until after
the final fall of Napoleon, and during this period nothing was
done to further the renewal of the search for a northwest
passage, until 1817, when Captain Scoresby published an account
of the great disruption of the ice in the Greenland seas,
and pointed to the ease with which explorations might then be
carried on in the Arctics. He was aided by Sir John Barrow,
secretary to the Admiralty, who, by his writings and personal
influence, induced the British government to again undertake a
series of Arctic explorations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two ships, well equipped for wintering in the north, were
fitted out to explore the regions westward of Davis strait. The
<span class='it'>Isabella</span>, commanded by Captain John Ross, and the <span class='it'>Alexander</span>,
by Lieutenant William Edward Parry, were selected for this
undertaking. They sailed on the 3rd of May, and were first
stopped by ice just north of Disko island on the 17th of June.
Melville bay was crossed with some difficulty, and a delay of a
week occurred near Cape York. At midnight on the 19th of
August the <span class='it'>Isabella</span> was in latitude 76° 54´ N., with the Cary
islands bearing southeast; this was the most northerly point
reached. Ross considered Smith sound a closed bay, and named
the capes forming each side of it Isabella and Alexander, after
the ships. He stated that the sound probably extended eighteen
leagues; sailing down the western side, the mouths of Jones
and Lancaster sounds were passed, both free from ice, but Ross
did not enter them. He described Lancaster sound as closed by
the Crocker mountains. The expedition returned to England in
October, having practically accomplished nothing beyond confirming
the statements of Baffin made many years before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of Ross was not thought conclusive by the Admiralty,
and in 1819 the <span class='it'>Hecla</span> and <span class='it'>Griper</span> were commissioned
to explore Lancaster sound. Lieutenant Parry was given command
in the <span class='it'>Hecla</span>, with Lieutenant Mathew Liddon in the
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>
<span class='it'>Griper</span>. The ships, without much difficulty, reached the mouth
of Lancaster sound, and sailing over the supposed Croker mountains,
continued westward past Regent inlet on the south, and
Wellington channel and Byam Martin channel on the north,
reached the south side of Melville island, where the winter
was safely passed by both ships in a small cove called Winter
harbour. The following summer an attempt was made to penetrate
the heavy arctic ice which forms a perpetual barrier across
the strait between Melville island and Banks island; this proving
impossible, the expedition returned safely to England in
October, 1820. Parry on his voyage passed over nearly half the
distance between the Atlantic and Pacific, and saw from his
farthest western point the shores of Banks island beyond the
middle of that distance. He laid down, on the north of his
track, the chain of islands bearing the names of North Devon,
Cornwallis, Bathurst and Melville; and on the south, North
Somerset, Cape Walker and Banks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir W. E. Parry, in 1821, made his third voyage to the Arctic
islands, in command of the <span class='it'>Fury</span>, having as second in
command Captain G. F. Lyon, in the <span class='it'>Hecla</span>. This time the
attempt was made through Hudson strait and up Fox channel.
The first season, he examined Repulse bay and went into winter
quarters at Winter island, a few miles beyond the eastern
entrance of the Frozen strait of Middleton, whose accuracy was
proved after being long clouded by the reckless attacks of Dobbs.
The ships were released from the ice on the 28th of June, and
no time was lost in pushing northward, until stopped by the
heavy ice off the eastern mouth of Fury and Hecla strait, where
the remainder of that season and the early part of the next were
spent in trying to pass through the strait, the eastern part of
which remained continuously blocked with heavy ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A fourth time Parry tried to make the northwest passage, by
way of Regent inlet. This attempt was terminated by the shipwreck
of the <span class='it'>Fury</span>, commanded by Captain Hoppner. With
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
great forethought, Parry caused all the provisions to be landed
from the wreck and safely housed on Fury beach, where they
were subsequently found by Ross, and were the means of rescuing
his crew from starvation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the time that Parry was making his important discoveries
by sea, Lieutenant John Franklin was employed in
tracing the northern shores of the American continent. From
1819 to 1822 Franklin was engaged in leading an expedition
overland from Hudson bay to the Arctic shores, in the vicinity
of the Coppermine river. The Admiralty, who planned the
expedition, knew practically nothing about the conditions for
travel through the regions that it purposed exploring, and depended
for aid solely upon the Hudson’s Bay Company.
Unfortunately, at this time the quarrel between the Hudson’s
Bay Company and the North-west Company was at its height,
and the resources of both were consequently greatly crippled.
The North-west Company were far stronger in the Mackenzie
river valley, and their rivals, who were to help Franklin, were
unable to give him very efficient aid, or to supply him with a
large stock of provisions; in consequence, he started from the
outposts with almost no food, determining to trust to his hunters
for the provisions required for his party. This finally led to
disaster, and on the retreat from the Arctic sea, over one-half of
the party, including Lieutenant Hood, died of starvation.
Franklin left England in the Hudson’s Bay Company’s ship,
accompanied by Lieutenants Back and Hood, Dr. Richardson
and one seaman. They arrived at York Factory, and there met
four of the leading partners of the North-west Company, who
were held prisoners by their rivals. As these men had spent a
number of years in the Mackenzie river country, Franklin
obtained much valuable information from them. After a few
days at York, the party proceeded by canoes from there, 650
miles to Cumberland House, on the Saskatchewan river,
where the first winter was passed. The following summer
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
the party, reinforced by a number of Canadian voyageurs,
started northward in canoes, and reached Fort Chipewyan,
on Great Slave lake, before the ice had melted. The expedition,
now consisting of twenty-five persons, started away
from Fort Chipewyan with one day’s supply of provisions and
a totally inadequate amount of ammunition. Travelling to the
north side of the lake, the party was further increased by a band
of the Copper Indians, and all journeyed to Fort Enterprize,
which was built near the edge of the barren lands, in latitude
64° 30´ N. The total distance travelled during this season was
1,350 miles. Venison was plentiful during the winter, but the
supply failed in the spring, so that a start was made over the
barrens without any food except such as fell to the hunters from
day to day. The distance from Fort Enterprize to the mouth
of Coppermine river is 334 miles. The first 120 miles were
made by tramping with canoes and outfit over the snow; the
remainder was made in canoes, and the mouth of the river was
reached on the 21st of July. Turning eastward, the shores of
Bathurst inlet and Coronation gulf were surveyed to Point
Turnagain, in latitude 68° 19´ N. and longitude 109° 25´ W.
The canoes were detained here for several days by a snowstorm,
and a retreat was necessary as soon as the weather moderated.
The course along the coast was therefore retraced to Hood river,
and that stream was ascended for a short distance. The equipment
was reduced to the smallest compass, and a course was
shaped overland for Fort Enterprize, the travelling being
through deep snow. Game was very scarce, and the hardships
soon began to tell on the weaker members of the party, with the
result, as before stated, that half the number succumbed to cold
and starvation. The survivors were succoured by Indians on
the 7th of November, and reached the Hudson’s Bay post on
Great Slave lake on the 11th of December, and England in
October, 1822.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1825-27, Captain Sir John Franklin resumed his exploration
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
of the Arctic coasts of America in much happier circumstances.
The rival fur companies had now amalgamated,
forming one powerful company, with full control over the
natives, and capable of rendering valuable assistance to an
exploring party in the far north. Franklin, profiting by his
former sad experience, had a large supply of pemmican prepared
in advance, and stored at Fort Chipewyan. The journey
from England was made by way of Montreal and the great
lakes. After passing a winter at Great Bear lake, Franklin
descended the Mackenzie to its mouth, and then surveyed the
coast westward to Return reef, passing the northern end of the
Rocky mountains, leaving only 160 miles of unsurveyed coast
between his farthest point and Point Barrow, reached the same
year by Captain Beechey in boats from Bering straits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Franklin was thus engaged with one-half of his party,
the other half, under the command of Dr. Richardson and Lieutenant
Kendall, were exploring the coast between the mouths of
the Mackenzie and Coppermine rivers. These surveys carried
the exploration from Bering strait to Coronation gulf, with
only a break of 160 miles between Return reef and Point Barrow,
or through sixty degrees of longitude. The eastern end of
these surveys was overlapped six degrees in longitude by the
discoveries of Parry to the northward, and only a channel
running north and south was required to connect them, and so
complete the long sought northwest passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Captain John Ross, being anxious to remove the reproach of
his former failure, and having been provided by Sir Felix Booth
with a well-fitted ship, the <span class='it'>Victory</span>, of 150 tons, sailed, in 1829,
with the intention of seeking a passage through Regent inlet.
The ship was set fast in the ice, and finally abandoned in Victoria
harbour, on the west side of Regent inlet, nearly opposite
Fury and Hecla strait. The expedition was remarkable for
the number of winters spent within the Arctic circle, three of
them on the <span class='it'>Victory</span> and the fourth at Fury beach, where the
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
provisions thoughtfully housed by Parry were the means of
saving the crew from starvation. They at length escaped from
the ice in their boats, and were picked up by a whaler in Lancaster
sound. Sir John Ross surveyed the shores adjoining his
winter quarters, and named the lower part of Regent inlet the
Gulf of Boothia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The chief discoveries were made by Lieutenant James Clark
Ross, who, by several long sled journeys, traced a part of the
shores of King William island, and of the west side of the
peninsula of Boothia, up to the Magnetic Pole; also the shores
of Lord Mayors bay and its vicinity in the Gulf of Boothia.
During the retreat to Fury beach, Brentford bay was crossed
several times without notice being taken of Bellot strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considerable anxiety was felt in England, after two winters
had passed without any tidings of the <span class='it'>Victory</span>, and Captain
Back was outfitted by public subscription to descend the Great
Fish river to its mouth, and there if possible, with the help of
natives, succour the crew of the <span class='it'>Victory</span>. Back spent the winter
of 1834 at Great Slave lake, and the following summer crossed
the height-of-land and descended Great Fish river to its mouth
in a heavy boat. Having been informed, by an express from
England, of the safe return of Ross, he confined himself to geographical
work, and traced the estuary of the river to Cape
Britannia on the one side and to Point Richardson on the other,
leaving only a short distance between his northern termination
and the southern point of James Ross’ southern sled journey.
The result of this journey left only 160 miles to the west of the
Mackenzie, and thirteen degrees of longitude between Franklin’s
Point Turnagain and the Gulf of Boothia to complete the
northwest passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hudson’s Bay Company undertook to fill these gaps of
unsurveyed coast-line, and sent an expedition under the direction
of Peter Warren Dease and Thomas Simpson, an expert
surveyor. The western section was first completed in 1837. In
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
1838-39 the eastern portion between Point Turnagain and the
estuary of the Great Fish river was surveyed by the same
intrepid explorers, without any loss of life to their party, and
without other hardships than those incidental to travel in the
Arctics. The boat voyages, by which these surveys were completed,
were the longest ever undertaken in arctic waters, and
embraced sixty-two degrees of longitude between Point Barrow
and Castor and Pollux river, the most eastern point of Simpson.
While surveying the coast to the eastward, Simpson charted the
south side of Victoria island and the south side of King
William island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately the advanced state of the season would not
permit Simpson to connect the mouth of Great Fish river with
Regent inlet, or with King William sea. This the Hudson’s
Bay Company resolved to complete, and in 1845 selected Dr.
John Rae for the work. Dr. Rae sailed in boats from Churchill
to Repulse bay, where he passed the winter, supporting his
party mainly by his own skill in hunting. The following spring
he portaged his boats, by a number of lakes, across the Rae
isthmus to the bottom of Committee bay, and surveyed the
southern part of the Gulf of Boothia to Fury and Hecla strait
on the east side, and to Lord Mayors bay on the west side, thus
proving that land having the width of four degrees of longitude
intervened between the Gulf of Boothia and the eastern bay of
the sea explored by Dease and Simpson. Dr. Rae returned in
his boats to York factory in the autumn of 1847, without losing
a man of his party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1824 Captain Lyon, in the <span class='it'>Griper</span>, made an unsuccessful
attempt to continue the work of Parry and himself in Fox
channel. He left England on the 20th of June, rounded Southampton
island on the 30th of August, and stood up Roes
Welcome, where excessively bad weather was met with. He
reached Wager inlet on the 12th of September, and when riding
out a gale lost his last two anchors, while the ship was rendered
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>
very leaky. In such a state he was unable to anchor, and was
obliged to return home immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second attempt to continue Parry’s work in the same region
was made by Captain Back, in 1836. He was in command of
the <span class='it'>Terror</span>, and left England on the 14th of June. On the first
of August he was among heavy ice, off Resolution island. On
the 23rd he was working through heavy ice on the east side of
Southampton island, and finally nearly reached Repulse bay,
where he intended to winter, when he was driven back late in
September, past Cape Comfort, out into the middle of Fox
channel, where the ship became fast frozen in, and drifted all
winter at the mercy of wind, tide and ice. Towards the close
of February the floe broke up, and the ship was caught in a
pressure ridge formed between great pieces of the broken floe.
In this manner the vessel continued to be tossed about and
squeezed until the 16th of March, when an extra heavy squeeze
lifted the ship up and left her stranded on the top of a great
mass of ice, caused by the piling of large broken cakes upon one
another. The <span class='it'>Terror</span> remained embedded on this mass of
ice, and drifted with it until released, on the 13th of June, near
Charles island, in Hudson strait. Notwithstanding the terrible
usage of the ship, Back managed to caulk and fit her, so that he
reached the coast of Ireland, but there had to run the ship
ashore to prevent her from sinking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Admiralty made no further attempt at Arctic exploration
for nine years after Back’s disastrous trip. In 1845, they
fitted out the <span class='it'>Erebus</span> and <span class='it'>Terror</span> with provisions for three years,
and with the most approved systems of heating and ventilating,
and other means of preserving the health and comfort of the
crews. The command of the expedition was given to Sir John
Franklin, with Captain Crozier, of the <span class='it'>Terror</span>, second in command.
The other officers were carefully selected from among
the most promising and energetic of the junior officers of the
navy, while the seamen and petty officers were also of the best
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
in the navy. The crews leaving England amounted to one
hundred and thirty-four persons, of whom five were sent home
from Greenland, leaving a total of one hundred and twenty-nine
on board the ships when they entered Lancaster sound, and
were seen for the last time. The fate of the expedition remained
for a number of years unknown, although the British government
spared no expense in the attempt to rescue the unfortunate
crews, and, when the hope of succouring was gone, in a search
for proof of their fate. Official relief expeditions were supplemented
by others under private auspices, due either to Lady
Franklin or to her appeals to the sympathy of the public for
convincing evidence as to the terrible fate of her unfortunate
husband and his companions. America joined forces with
England in the attempt to rescue the expedition, and sent
out a number of ships, to act in conjunction with the others,
while France sent two gallant officers, one of whom, Lieutenant
Bellot, lost his life while engaged in this work. As the conditions
under which the searches were made were exceedingly
difficult and hazardous, much time and energy were spent, and
many risked and lost their lives. Twelve years passed before
M’Clintock discovered undoubted proofs of the complete loss of
the ships and the death of the entire crews. During this time
thirty-five ships and five overland expeditions carried a host of
eager searchers to the Arctics, where, incidental to their main
object of rescuing the crews of the <span class='it'>Erebus</span> and <span class='it'>Terror</span>, they
explored the entire northern coast-line of America and the
shores of the Arctic islands, with such minute care as only their
mission would warrant. To these search expeditions our intimate
knowledge of Arctic America is largely due, and when the
search was finished only the most northern islands remained for
the future explorer.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>At Beechey Island.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Before entering upon a short statement of the work of the
search parties, the work and fate of Franklin’s expedition may
be traced. His instructions were to enter Lancaster sound, and,
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>
when in the vicinity of Cape Walker, to penetrate to the southward
and westward in a course as direct as possible to Bering
strait. A quick passage appears to have been made through
Lancaster sound to Wellington channel, up which the ships
sailed to the seventy-seventh parallel, and then down again on
the west side of Cornwallis island, returning eastward to winter
at Beechey island. Many traces of a winter residence were
found there, including sites of workshops, forge and observatory.
Over 700 empty meat cans, all labelled ‘Goldner’s
Patent,’ were found piled in regular mounds. A large quantity
of similar tins supplied to the navy had been found to be putrid,
and were condemned. This had probably happened to the tins
left at Beechey island, and helped to hasten the starvation of
the unfortunate crews two winters later. Three seamen died
during the first winter, and were buried on the island. The
next information concerning the fate of Franklin was obtained
from a brief record, found on King William island by
M’Clintock, in 1859. The record is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘Lieutenant
Graham Gore and Mr. Charles F. des Vœux, mate, left the ships
on Monday, the 24th of May, 1847, with six men (to deposit
papers on King William’s island)’—‘H.M. ships <span class='it'>Erebus</span> and
<span class='it'>Terror</span> wintered in the ice in latitude 70° 5´ N., longitude
98° 23´ W. Having wintered in 1846-47 at Beechey island in
latitude 74° 43´ 28´´ N., longitude 91° 31´ 15´´ W. After having
ascended Wellington channel to latitude 77°, returned by
the west side of Cornwallis island, (Sir) John Franklin commanding
the expedition. All well.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This was the original
record, and a most mournful addition was made to it, on the
25th of April, 1848, after another winter in the ice. Here is
the addition:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘—(1)848. H.M. ships <span class='it'>Terror</span> and <span class='it'>Erebus</span> were

built by Sir James Ross in 1831, 4 miles to the northward,
where it had been deposited by the late Commander Gore in
June, 1847. Sir James Ross’ pillar has not, however, been
found, and the paper has been transferred to this position which
is that in which Sir J. Ross’ pillar was erected. Sir John
Franklin died on the 11th June, 1847, and the total loss by
deaths in the expedition has been to this date 9 officers &amp; 15
men. F. R. M. Crozier, Captain &amp; Senior Offr., and start on

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the sad story may be shortly
told: the distance to the mouth of the Fish river, from the spot
where the ships were abandoned, is about 250 miles. They
started from the ships dragging heavy boats on sleds. M’Clintock
found one of the boats on the west side of King William
island with two skeletons inside it; and the Eskimos told him
that the men dropped down and died in the drag ropes. The
Eskimos living at the mouth of Fish river said that about forty
white men reached the mouth of the river, and dragged a boat
as far as Montreal island in the estuary, where the natives
found it and broke it up. The last of the survivors died shortly
after the arrival of the summer birds. It is exceedingly doubtful,
if their strength had lasted, whether they could have
travelled over the thousand miles of barrens separating the
month of the river from the nearest trading post on Great Slave
lake, but at least a trial would have been made.</p>

of the fate of the <span class='it'>Erebus</span> and <span class='it'>Terror</span>, and a short
record of their proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The above list is taken from ‘The Polar Regions,’ by Sir John
Richardson, and gives a very brief statement of the numerous
expeditions sent out in search of these ill-fated ships. Lengthy
records of most of these expeditions have been published, in
which the trials and hardships undergone are recorded in a
matter-of-fact way, without any attempt to excite sympathy, and
all honour should be paid to the memory of these men, many of
them volunteers, for the dangers they passed through in the
endeavour to rescue their fellowmen from terrible death by
starvation and cold in the inaccessible Arctics. Many lost their
own lives, while others drifted all winter in ships crushed
between great floes of arctic ice; others, again, travelled through
the northern winter, with its short days and intensely cold
nights, with only a fireless tent to shield them from death in the
howling storms which sweep the treeless regions; all did their
duty, and were faithful unto death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A summary made shortly after the search ended, gives the
length of coast-line examined by the various searching
parties as follows: Sir James Ross, in 1849, explored 990 miles
of coast-line on the eastern side of Peel strait, in Lancaster
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>
sound and in Regent inlet; Captain Austen traced 6,087
miles; Sir Edward Belcher and Captain Kellett, 9,432
miles; Sir Robert M’Clure, 2,350 miles; Captain Collison in
his voyage to Cambridge bay, and Dr. Rae on the same coasts,
1,030 miles, making in all, 21,500 miles of coast-line examined,
of which 5,780 miles were previously unknown. From this
summary the search of the American expeditions is omitted, as
well as those of Lady Franklin’s private expeditions, all of
which would add greatly to the total. Admiral Sir F. L.
M’Clintock has estimated the amount of money expended
by the British government on Arctic research, including the
outfitting of the <span class='it'>Erebus</span> and <span class='it'>Terror</span>, at £272,000, and on the
relief and search expeditions, £675,000; to this must be added
the money subscribed for private expeditions, amounting to
£35,000. The expeditions fitted out in the United States, mostly
by private subscriptions, cost over $250,000. Admiral M’Clintock
has further estimated that the number of miles traversed by
sled expeditions only, over ice and land, is about 43,000 miles.
His views as regards the economic and scientific value of the
Arctic explorations are as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘The benefits, doubtless, have
been very great; to whaling commerce it has opened up all to the
north and west of Davis strait and Hudson strait; also to the
north of Bering strait. The value of these fisheries alone
amounts to very many millions sterling into the pockets of English
and American traders. The scientific results are very
varied, and ample in almost every department, and peculiarly so
in magnetism, meteorology, the tides, geographical discoveries,
geology, botany and zoology, as shown by the general advance in
each branch. Upon naval impulse the influence has been truly
great; we could man an expedition with English naval officers.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The exploration of Smith sound, the northern inlet to Baffin
bay, was commenced during the search for Franklin. In 1852,
Captain Inglefield left England, in the screw schooner <span class='it'>Isabel</span>,
with the intention of searching the deep northern inlets of Baffin
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>
bay for traces of Franklin, and with the hope of reaching the
open Polar sea through Smith sound. Cape Farewell was
sighted on the 30th of July, and Cape York on the 21st of
August where a number of natives were seen in the vicinity.
At North Omenak native caches of meat and winter clothing
were found. On the 26th Cape Alexander, the farthest point
seen by Baffin, was passed, with an open sea to the northward.
On the 27th he reached latitude 78° 21´ N. one hundred and
forty miles beyond any previous navigator. He was forced by a
strong northerly gale and low temperature to retreat south, and
on his way entered Jones sound, which he explored to latitude
76° 11´ N. and longitude 84° 10´ W. He then entered Lancaster
sound, and visited Beechey island, after which, turning
homeward, he did not cross the Arctic circle until the 12th of
October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1853, Dr. Elisha Kent Kane left New York in the brig
<span class='it'>Advance</span>, fitted out by Henry Grinnell and George Peabody, to
assist in the search for Franklin. The <span class='it'>Advance</span> entered Smith
sound on the 7th of August, and, after considerable danger and
trouble with ice, was moored in Rensselaer bay, from which she
never emerged. This wintering place was about 120 miles
north of any previously attained, being in latitude 78° 38´ and
longitude 70° 40´. Kane confined his explorations to the
Greenland side of the sound, and personally reached the southern
edge of the great Humboldt glacier, while Dr. Hayes,
surgeon to Kane, crossed Kane basin to the neighbourhood of
Cape Fraser, and William Morton, on the Greenland coast,
passed the Humboldt glacier and attained latitude 80° 35´ in
the vicinity of Cape Constitution, where from an elevation of
500 feet he saw open water in Kennedy channel extending to
the north as far as the eye could reach. In July, 1854, the ice
being still firm, Kane attempted to reach Beechey island, where
he knew that assistance could be obtained, but had to return
before reaching Cape Parry.   At the end of August, Hayes and
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>
eight others of the crew left the ship with the intention of reaching
the Danish settlement of Upernivik; they returned in
December, nearly dead of starvation and cold. The vessel was
formally abandoned on the 20th of May following, and on the
17th of June the boats were launched in open water near Cape
Alexander. Cape York was doubled on the 21st of July, and
the greatly reduced party reached Upernivik on the 6th of
August.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. I. I. Hayes was the next to attempt to reach the supposed
open sea, by way of Smith sound. He left Boston, in the
schooner <span class='it'>United States</span>, on the 7th of July, 1860, and on the
12th of August reached Upernivik, where he added six natives
to his crew, bringing the total number up to twenty-one. Meeting
with a succession of northerly gales off Cape Alexander,
Hayes was obliged to winter south of Littleton island, in Foulke
fiord, in latitude 78° 18´ N. He first tried to explore the
Greenland coast, but was obliged to abandon the attempt on
account of the very rough ice. He then determined to cross
Kane basin and follow the west coast northward. Thirty-eight
days were occupied in crossing the seventy miles between the
ship and Cape Hawkes, after which he claims that six days’ travel
brought him to Cape Lieber, situated 170 miles beyond
Cape Hawkes; this is evidently a mistake. The ship was
released on the 10th of July, and the passage north being barred
by solid ice, Hayes crossed to the west side, and explored the
coast southward from Cape Sabine to Cape Isabella before
returning home. He was thus making good the claim of being
the first white man to tread the shores of Ellesmere island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next expedition to Smith sound was commanded by
Charles F. Hall, in the <span class='it'>Polaris</span>. Hall had previously spent two
years among the natives at Frobisher bay, the charting of which
is due to his efforts. On his return from this first trip he went,
in a whaler, to Roes Welcome, where he again lived with and
like the natives, in an attempt to recover the logs and other
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>
records of the <span class='it'>Erebus</span> and <span class='it'>Terror</span>. He remained in the country
for four winters before he succeeded in reaching the southern
shores of King William island; he was unsuccessful in his
quest. Hall throughout his journeys kept a voluminous journal;
he took meteorological observations and observations for
his position. His instruments appear to have been not of the
best, and Hall seems to have had a great faith in the statements
of the natives, a faith that was often abused; in consequence,
much of his information from that source is quite unreliable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To return to the <span class='it'>Polaris</span> expedition, fitted out by the United
States government, with the object of reaching the North Pole.
She left New York on the 29th of June, 1871, with a crew of
twenty-three, which was increased by ten Greenlanders. Melville
bay was crossed in thirty-four hours, and Smith sound
being free of ice, an almost uninterrupted passage was made
through Kane basin and Kennedy channel, so that the Polar
ocean was reached on the 31st of August in latitude 82° 11´,
to the northwest of Repulse harbour, where heavy, ancient,
arctic ice stopped further progress. Returning southward, the
<span class='it'>Polaris</span> went into winter quarters at Thank God harbour. Hall,
in October, reached Cape Brevoort, but died suddenly shortly
after his return, and this calamity put a stop to further efforts
to reach the Pole. Some explorations were made in the early
spring before it was decided to return home. On the way south
the ship was caught in the ice in Kennedy channel, on the 14th
of August, and remained fast in the pack until the 15th of
October, when a furious gale broke up the pack, in sight of
Northumberland island, after nearly destroying her in the process
of disruption. When this occurred several of the party
who were on the ice landing stores were left, and drifted southward
1,500 miles on the ice, being rescued by the <span class='it'>Tigress</span>, off
the coast of Labrador, on the 30th of April, 1872. The vessel
was beached at Life Boat cove, and the remainder of the crew
passed the winter in safety in a house built from the wreck.
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>
During the winter two boats were built, in which the party
started to retreat on Upernivik, but were fortunately rescued
by a relief steamer in the vicinity of Cape York.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The British Government, in 1875, fitted out an expedition
with Captain George Nares in command of the <span class='it'>Alert</span>, and Captain
Stephenson, second in command, on the <span class='it'>Discovery</span>, while
the complete crews numbered one hundred and thirty officers
and men, with three native dog-drivers. The instructions, which
were to proceed up Smith sound, indicated that the primary
object of the expedition was to attain the highest northern latitude,
and, if possible, the North Pole, including explorations to
the adjacent coasts from winter quarters. The ships left England
on the 29th of May, and Cape York was reached on the
25th of July, after very little trouble with the ice. Here the
first of a series of caches of provisions was established, to provide
for the safety of the crews in case they were obliged to
abandon the ships and retreat southward over the ice. These
caches were not used, and being left for future explorations
were the means of preserving life in the survivors of Greely’s
party some years later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Cape York the passage northward was a constant
struggle with immense floes of heavy ice, so that it was the
25th of August before the <span class='it'>Discovery</span> anchored for the winter in
Discovery harbour. The <span class='it'>Alert</span> pushed on, and reached Floeberg
beach, in latitude 82° 25´ N., and longitude 61° 30´ W.,
where further progress was barred by the heavy ancient ice of
the Polar sea, to which Nares has given the name paleocrystic,
to distinguish it from the ice of more southern waters, which is
formed annually. Here the <span class='it'>Alert</span> was moored for the winter,
exposed to the crushing action and movement of these solid floes,
in a latitude far north of that before attained by any ship.
Depots of provisions were established during the autumn by
sledging parties for use in the following spring. On the 3rd of
April seven sleds, manned by fifty-three men and officers, left
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>
the <span class='it'>Alert</span> for northern explorations. One party, under Commander
Markham, was to push northward over the frozen
ocean; the other, under Lieutenant Aldrich, to explore the
north coast of Grinnell land. Markham, after great toil and
hardships, hauling heavy sledges and boats over exceedingly
rough ice, and with five of his eighteen men helpless from the
effects of scurvy, succeeded in reaching a point on the ice in
latitude 83° 20´ 26´´, the farthest north to that date. The
health of the men became worse on the return journey, and if
Lieutenant Parr had not, by a forced march of twenty-four
hours, reached the ship for assistance, all would probably have
been lost; as it was, one died and eleven others had to be
dragged to the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lieutenant Aldrich surveyed two hundred and twenty miles
of new coast, reaching, on the 18th of May, Point Albert, in
82° 16´, and 85° 33´ W. His party, also attacked by scurvy,
would not have reached the ship without assistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exploring parties were, at the same time, in the field from
the <span class='it'>Discovery</span>. Lieutenant Archer explored Franklin sound
and reached the head of Archer fiord. Lieutenant Beaumont
left the ship with two sleds, and, after first visiting the <span class='it'>Alert</span>,
crossed Robeson channel to Repulse harbour, on the coast of
Greenland. He succeeded in reaching with one man, the
eastern side of Sherard Osborne fiord, in 82° 20´ N. and 50°
45´ W., on the 20th of May. The return was made under distressing
circumstances; only Beaumont and one man were free
from scurvy when Repulse harbour was reached. The ice in
Robeson channel was too rotten to cross with his crew of invalids,
and but for the timely arrival of a relief party all would
have perished. Two men died, and only with great difficulty
did the remainder reach the ship. Owing to the scurvy, Captain
Nares wisely determined to return home. The disease had
attacked almost every man on the ships outside the officers, but
it is a mystery why it should have played such ravages on an
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>
expedition fitted out and provisioned with all possible precautions
against the disease; the only explanation given is that the
men were over-worked, slept in damp clothes, and were regularly
served with a liberal ration of spirits. The <span class='it'>Alert</span> left
Floeberg beach on the 31st of July, and on the 9th of September
both vessels safely reached the open sea, and recrossed the Arctic
circle on the 4th of October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1881 the United States government determined to establish
a meteorological station in connection with the
international polar stations in the region of Smith sound.
Congress voted an appropriation of $25,000 for this expedition,
a sum ridiculously small, as only $6,000 remained after paying
for the transport of the party to their destination. The expedition
was under the command of Lieutenant A. W. Greely, and
was composed of officers and men from the United States army,
none of whom had had previous experience in Arctic work. The
party, numbering twenty-six, sailed from St. John’s, Newfoundland,
in the steam sealer <span class='it'>Proteus</span>, on the 4th of July,
1881. At Upernivik two Eskimo dog-drivers were added to
their number. Little trouble was experienced from the ice until
the ship reached Discovery bay, where the station was to be
located, and after a short delay the party was landed on the
11th of August. Two men found to be physically unfit were
sent home. A house was soon erected, and the observation work
carried on regularly during the time that the expedition remained
there. In the spring of 1882 several sled journeys were
made, the most important being that of Lieutenant Lockwood,
who crossed Kennedy channel, and passing northeastward along
the coast of Greenland pushed beyond the farthest point reached
by Lieutenant Beaumont, and succeeded in reaching latitude
83° 23´ N., the highest attained at that time. The <span class='it'>Neptune</span>
attempted to relieve them during the summer of 1882, but
found Smith sound blocked with ice. The second autumn and
spring were spent in making explorations, chiefly in Ellesmere
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
island. Lockwood attempted to pass his previous record, but
was prevented by the loose ice and the rugged mountains along
the northern coast. As no relief ship arrived and parts of the
supplies were running short, a retreat was decided upon, and
the party started south in a steam launch and two boats, on the
11th of August. Great trouble was experienced in the heavy
ice, and they were obliged to abandon their boats on the 10th of
September, after having been beset by the ice for two weeks.
Land was reached at Cape Sabine on the 29th of September,
where a poor shelter of stones and canvas was erected, in which
the party passed the winter. Their provisions comprised the
remainder of the food taken with them, and a small quantity
landed from the <span class='it'>Proteus</span> after that vessel sank from an ice nip
while trying to reach Greely a few weeks earlier in the season.
The bulk of their provisions was obtained from the caches left
by Nares in 1875. Exposure to the weather had nearly ruined
everything left in the caches, but their contents, even in this
shape, were of great assistance to these famished men; without
them all would have succumbed; as it was, only seven survived
the hardships and starvation, when the rescue steamer arrived
on the 22nd of June, 1883.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next Arctic work was the crossing of the Greenland ice-cap,
in 1893, by Nansen, who landed on the eastern side, and
with a few companions succeeded in passing over the immense
fields of ice and snow, coming out on the coast of the western
side to the southward of Disko.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lieutenant R. E. Peary, United States navy, spent eight
winters in the regions about Smith sound. During these
years none of the ships engaged to take supplies to him were
able to penetrate more than the southern portion of Smith
sound, and consequently Peary had to haul all his provisions
and outfit over the very rough ice in dog-sleds two hundred
miles before he arrived at the original starting point of Beaumont
and Lockwood. This was a handicap of the severest description,
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
and Peary deserves the greatest credit for the manful
way in which he overcame it, and succeeded in not only crossing
the ice-cap of the northern part of Greenland, but also in
tracing its northern outline far to the eastward, and so establishing
the certainty of the island character of that supposed
peninsula.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last of the expeditions to the Smith sound region was
that headed by Captain Sverdrup, in the famous <span class='it'>Fram</span>. This
expedition started with the intention of exploring the northern
part of Greenland, but found Smith sound blocked with ice,
and the <span class='it'>Fram</span> was obliged to pass the winter of 1898-99 at Cape
Sabine, where Greely’s party passed their last winter. In the
spring, parties from the ship explored Hayes sound, and crossed
Ellesmere island to its west coast. In 1899 Smith sound continued
closed, and Sverdrup returned south with the intention
of exploring Jones sound. Taking the <span class='it'>Fram</span> up that channel,
he went into the second winter quarters on its north side, in a
small fiord on the south coast of Ellesmere island. During the
following spring two long sled journeys were made to the north
and west, occupying seventy-six and ninety days respectively.
The <span class='it'>Fram</span> broke out of winter quarters on the 9th of August,
1901, and proceeding westward was beset off the north coast of
Grinnell peninsula until the middle of September, when she
was again released, and reached winter quarters in Belcher
channel at the western end of Jones sound. In the spring of
1902 two long journeys were again undertaken by Sverdrup
and Isacksen, involving important discoveries. The <span class='it'>Fram</span> could
not be released, and a fourth winter had to be faced. Sverdrup
made his longest and most important journey in the spring of
1902, while his companions were making minor trips. On the
6th of August the <span class='it'>Fram</span> was released, and returned to Norway,
after having completed the last great and important work that
remained to be done in the Arctics, thus finishing the work
begun three centuries ago. The principal achievements were the
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
mapping of Jones sound and the western side of Ellesmere
island, the discovery of a large island lying on the west side of
Ellesmere island, and two other large islands in latitude 79°,
extending westward to longitude 106° W., which is that of the
eastern side of Melville island, while North Cornwall and Findlay
islands were seen to the south. To the westward and northward
no signs of land were seen, and the ancient Arctic ice was
found pressing on the coasts of these new northern islands, so
that the line of drift pressure can now be traced from Bering
sea to the east coast of Greenland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little is known of the interior of even the more southerly of
the Arctic islands. Up to the present time exploration has been
largely confined to their coasts, with only a few isolated lines
run across their interiors. In this way, however, sufficient
knowledge has been obtained to give a general idea of the geography,
which will probably be greatly modified when future
explorations have given more information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thanks to the work done by the numerous search parties for
the unfortunate Franklin and his companions, the coast lines
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>
of many of even the most northern islands have been thoroughly
explored. The work left undone by these parties has since been
practically finished by the British expedition of 1875, and by
the work of Greely, Peary and Sverdrup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The physical features of the coasts visited by the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>
have been described in detail in the narrative of the voyage, and
need not be repeated here. All other information concerning
the geography of these northern lands has been obtained from
the printed records of earlier Arctic travellers, and is here used
to give some general idea of the extent and physical condition
of these islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The islands of the Arctic archipelago extend from the north
side of Hudson bay and Hudson strait, in 62° N. latitude to
83° N. latitude, a distance of 1,500 miles. Their greatest
extension westward is along the 73rd parallel, from the west
side of Baffin bay to 125° W. longitude, a distance of 500 miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The islands have, for convenience, been divided into four
natural groups, as follows:—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Group I.</span>—The islands situated in the northern parts of
Hudson bay and Hudson strait. These include the great island
of Southampton, together with the smaller islands of Coats,
Mansfield, Nottingham, Salisbury, Charles, Akpatok, Resolution
and many other small ones still unnamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Group II.</span>—Includes the islands lying between Hudson bay
and Hudson strait, on the south, and Lancaster sound on the
north, the western boundary of the group being Prince Regent
inlet. The largest of all the islands, Baffin, belongs to this
group. The only other island of considerable size is Bylot,
while the remainder are small and fringe these two large
islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Group III.</span>—This contains the islands lying west of Prince
Regent inlet and south of Lancaster sound, and its western continuation,
Barrow strait. These islands are almost inaccessible,
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>
as they lie to the west and south of the ice-covered waters of
Lancaster sound, the only channel by which they may be
reached from the eastward; while the western islands of the
group can only be reached by passing through the Arctic ocean
from Bering strait, a long distance to the eastward of them.
They are comprised of Banks, Victoria, Prince of Wales, North
Somerset and King William islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Group IV.</span>—The islands north of Lancaster sound and Barrow
strait. Those include the great islands of Ellesmere and
North Devon, whose eastern sides front on Baffin bay and Smith
sound; the Parry islands—Cornwallis, Bathurst, Byam Martin,
Melville, Eglinton and Prince Patrick—all on the north side of
Barrow strait; the Sverdrup islands—Axel Heiberg, Ellef
Ringnes, Amund Ringnes, King Christian and North Cornwall—situated
to the west of Ellesmere and to the north of the
Parry islands.</p>

an area greater than 500 square miles:—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The configuration and the physical features of the islands
depend upon the character of the rocks that form them; in
consequence, a brief description of the geology of these northern
regions is here given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Granites, gneisses and other crystalline rocks, very similar to
those forming the Archæan system of more southern regions,
occupy the eastern shores of the great islands fronting on Baffin
bay and Davis strait, from Smith sound to Hudson strait. On
Ellesmere island these rocks form a wide band down the east side
from the neighbourhood of Cape Sabine to Jones sound, where
the western boundary is upwards of fifty miles from the mouth
of the sound. They occupy the eastern part of North Devon,
reaching, on its south side, some seventy miles up Lancaster
sound. The whole of Bylot island and that part of northern
Baffin island to the eastward of Admiralty inlet is formed of
these rocks. The great island of Baffin has upwards of three-quarters
of its area underlain by Archæan granites and other
crystalline rocks, while the eastern side of Southampton belongs
to that formation which is also found at Salisbury, Nottingham
and Charles islands of Group I.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To the westward of this wide rim of Archæan rocks is a great
basin which has been filled with deposits of limestone, sandstone
and other bedded rocks belonging to the Palæozoic or middle
formations of the earth’s crust. These rocks extend upward
from the Silurian to the Carboniferous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lower rocks, consisting largely of limestones, are the most
widely distributed. They extend southward and westward far
beyond the limits included in this report. The rocks newer
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>
than these Silurian limestones are not found south of Lancaster
sound and Barrow strait, except on the northern part of Banks
island at the extreme west of the archipelago. These rocks of
Devonian and Carboniferous age occupy the Parry islands and
the western and northern parts of Ellesmere, and in many
places contain good deposits of coal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A yet newer series of rocks belonging to the Mesozoic are
found along the western edge of Ellesmere and on the Sverdrup
islands. Isolated patches of later Tertiary age probably also
occur along the northern and eastern coasts of Baffin island, and
are of importance in that they are often associated with deposits
of lignite coal. Small areas of this age have been found in the
Parry islands and on the western part of Banks island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On these northern islands the country underlain by the crystalline
Archæan rocks is very similar in physical character to
like areas of more southern regions. Where these rocks occur,
the coast is usually greatly broken by irregularly shaped bays
and headlands. The shores are often fringed with rocky
islands, and the adjacent sea-bottom is liable to be very uneven.
The land, as a rule, rises rapidly from the coast into an uneven
plateau or tableland, whose general level is broken by ridges of
rounded hills which seldom rise more than a few hundred feet
above the general level. The elevation of the tableland varies
from a few hundred feet to an extreme height of nearly five
thousand feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the northern parts the surface of this Archæan tableland
is usually covered with a thick ice-cap, through which only the
loftier hills protrude. The valleys leading down to the coast
from the ice-cap are filled with large glaciers which project into
the bays, where they discharge numerous icebergs. As the ice-cap
becomes thinner in the more southern parts the glaciers
become less active, and generally terminate without reaching
the sea, and consequently no icebergs are formed from
them.
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The country, formed of the limestones and other Palæozoic
rocks, differs in its physical character from that already described.
On the northern islands, where these rocks attain a
considerable thickness, the land rises in abrupt cliffs directly
from the sea. The summits of these cliffs vary in elevation
from 1,000 to 3,000 feet, while the country behind is a tableland
rising in steps inland, the front of each step being a cliff
usually of much less thickness than the initial one by which the
land rises from the sea. In the more northern islands the higher
portions of these tablelands support ice-caps generally much
thinner than those covering the adjoining Archæan tablelands.
The coasts composed of these flat-bedded limestones are deeply
indented by narrow bays or fiords in the valleys of the more important
streams; each small stream and rill flowing off the land
has left its sculptured mark upon the cliffs, so that the whole
resembles, on a great scale, the banks of a stream cut into a
deep deposit of clay. This minute sculpturing of the rocks
points to their having been elevated above the sea for a very
long period, during which time the streams were actively at
work cutting their valleys down to the sea-level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These high abrupt cliffs are characteristic of the islands
on both sides of Lancaster sound and to the northward
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The limestone islands of Hudson bay and that portion of
southwest Baffin underlain by these rocks are very low and
flat, with shallow water extending several miles from their
shores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those northern islands, wholly or in part formed of the
Mesozoic rocks, are characterized by low shores and no great
elevation inland. At Ponds inlet, where an area of Tertiary
deposits occurs, the country overlying it forms a wide plain
deeply cut into by the streams that drain it.
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span></p>

<h2>ISLANDS OF GROUP I.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The islands of Hudson bay and Hudson strait are, naturally,
divided into two sections by their physical characters, the first
composed of those formed from the crystalline Archæan rocks,
the second of the low islands of limestone. The first division
includes Resolution, Big, Salisbury, Charles and Nottingham
islands, together with many smaller ones along the north side
of Hudson strait. These islands are physically alike, being
moderately high and having ragged shore lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resolution island lies on the north side of the eastern
entrance to Hudson strait. It is nearly forty miles long, and
averages twenty-five miles in breadth. The general elevation of
the interior is under five hundred feet, and the land appears to
rise quickly from the shores. The island is fringed by many
rocky islets, and a number of good harbours are said to occur
on all sides of it, but owing to the strong currents about the
coast it has been rarely visited, except by ships caught in the
ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Big island lies close to the north shore of the strait, and about
one hundred and forty miles beyond its eastern entrance. The
island is triangular in shape; the longest side, parallel to the
mainland, has a length of thirty miles, the other two sides being
each about twenty-five miles long. In physical character and
elevation it is very like Resolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles is a narrow island some twenty-five miles long,
situated in the southern part of the strait, being distant about
twenty-five miles from the south side; its west end is ninety
miles from Cape Wolstenholme at the western end of the strait.
The eastern half of the island is high and rugged, and is connected
with the lower rocky western end by a narrow sandy
neck. The highest part of the western end does not reach
an altitude of two hundred feet, and terminates in a long
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>
low point with shallow water extending from it for several
miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nottingham and Salisbury islands lie in the western entrance
to Hudson strait. Their longer axis lies northwest and southeast.
Nottingham is the more southward, and is about
thirty-five miles long and averages about ten miles across.
Salisbury lies to the northeast of Nottingham, and is separated
from it by a deep channel about fifteen miles wide. The northern
island is the larger, being nearly forty miles long and
averaging fifteen miles across. Both are high and rugged, with
a number of bays affording good harbours, especially at the
southeast and northwest ends. The general altitude of these
islands is nearly five hundred feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second division of the islands of Group I. includes the
large island of Southampton, together with Coats, Mansfield
and Akpatok islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Southampton is situated in the northern part of Hudson bay,
which it divides into Fox channel on its east side and Roes
Welcome on the other side, being separated from the mainland
at its north end by the narrow Frozen strait. The island attains
its greatest length from north to south, covering three degrees
of latitude, or a distance of two hundred and ten miles. Its
greatest breadth of two hundred miles is across its southern
part; its eastern side trends northwest, and its western shore
lies north and south, so that the shape is practically a triangle,
having an area of 19,100 square miles. The greater part of the
island is occupied by flat-bedded limestone, causing the southern
and western shores to be generally low and flat, with a margin
of shallow water extending several miles from the land. Along
the eastern side a band of crystalline rocks extends from Seahorse
point to the north end of the island, and this forms much
higher land with bolder water adjoining than is found elsewhere.
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Coats island lies directly south of Southampton, from which
it is separated by Evans and Fisher straits. With the exception
of a ridge of moderately high land crossing the island diagonally
at its eastern end, the island is low and flat, having no
elevation of over a hundred feet. Its longer axis of one hundred
miles lies nearly northeast and southwest, while its greatest
breadth is about twenty-five miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mansfield island, being wholly composed of limestone, is
everywhere low and flat, with no elevations greatly exceeding a
hundred feet. The island, with a length of seventy-five miles,
lies parallel to and about that distance from the east coast of
Hudson bay, its north end being on a line with Cape Wolstenholme.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Akpatok island, included in this division on account of its
being of limestone formation, lies in the mouth of Ungava bay
of Hudson strait. It is nearly fifty miles long, and lies diagonally
to the west coast of the bay, so that its southern end is
about thirty miles from the mouth of Payne river, while the
north end is nearly twice that distance from Cape Hopes
Advance. The limestone forming the island being more solid
than that of the western islands, the shore line is bolder and
more broken, the island rising in low cliffs directly from the
sea, and having a general elevation considerably higher than
that of those just described.</p>

<h2>ISLANDS OF GROUP II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Baffin island, with its area of 211,000 square miles, is the
largest and probably the most important and valuable of the
Arctic islands. Its southern shores form the north side of Hudson
strait; its eastern side extends from Hudson strait to
Lancaster sound, or from 61° N. latitude to 74° N. latitude, a
distance of over 850 miles fronting on Davis strait and Baffin
bay. The island is bounded on the north by Lancaster sound
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>
and on the east by Prince Regent inlet, Fury and Hecla strait
and Fox channel. As Archæan crystalline rocks occupy the
greater part of the island, the Silurian limestones being almost
confined to the western side, the coast is very irregular, and is
indented by deep bays, especially along the east and north sides.
The larger ones on the eastern side, passing northward, are
Frobisher bay, Cumberland gulf, Exeter sound, Home bay,
Clyde river, Scott inlet, and Ponds inlet, together with many
more of considerable size and length. The principal indentations
of the northern coast are the long narrow bays named
Navy Board and Admiralty inlets. Much of the western coast
is at present unexplored, but enough is known of it to say that
no very long bays are to be found there.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/120a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_120' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Head of Cyrus Field Bay, Baffin Island.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Islands are very numerous along those parts of the coast
formed of the crystalline rocks, and these vary greatly in
size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The coast between Ponds inlet and Cape Dier to the northward
of Cumberland gulf has never been properly surveyed,
and the present charts of this part are, according to the whaling
captains, quite erroneous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eastern coast of Baffin island is generally high and rocky.
The land rises quickly from the sea, often in abrupt cliffs, to
elevations of a thousand feet or more, after which the upward
slope is more gentle as the land rises towards the interior tableland.
The general elevation of the tableland, to the south of
Cumberland gulf, ranges from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, while to the
northward this wide coastal area is much higher, reaching a
general elevation of 5,000 feet, with hills rising above that
perhaps one or two thousand feet higher. Inland to the south
of Ponds inlet the general elevation does not appear to exceed
3,000 feet, and to the westward is considerably lower. The
land fronting on Lancaster sound, between Navy Board and
Admiralty inlets, is very rough and broken, and rises in the
interior to perhaps a general elevation of 2,000 feet. The
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
remainder of this northern coast between Admiralty inlet and
Prince Regent inlet is formed of flat-bedded limestone, and
rises in steep cliffs about a thousand feet high to a comparatively
flat plateau. This plateau with its cliffs continues down
the east side of Prince Regent inlet nearly to Fury and Hecla
strait, the land gradually becoming lower towards the south.
The eastern side of Fox channel is as yet unexplored, and all
information concerning it has been obtained from the Eskimos.
They describe the coast as generally low, and much the same in
character as that of the limestone islands of Hudson bay. The
limestone country terminates some distance north of King cape,
which marks the western limit of Hudson strait on its north
side, and the coast is again formed of crystalline rock, with its
characteristic broken outline and fringe of islands. The northern
shores of Hudson strait along its western half although bold
are not high, and the interior probably does not reach a general
elevation of 1,000 feet. To the eastward of Big island the coast
becomes higher, and the land rises slowly inland to elevations
of 2,000 to 3,000 feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The highlands to the northward of Cumberland gulf, along
the east side of the island, appear to be covered with an ice-cap,
from which glaciers flow down the valleys leading to the many
bays on this coast. These glaciers are neither as heavy nor as
active as those of the islands north of Lancaster sound, and only
rarely do they project into the sea and discharge icebergs. The
lower lands adjoining the coast are usually free of snow during
the summer. The ice-cap, according to the natives, does not
extend far inland, the interior being practically free of snow
during the summer months. About Cumberland gulf and to
the southward the highlands are partly snow-covered, but the
patches are detached, and there are no glaciers sufficiently large
to discharge into the sea. The Grinnell glacier is an ice-cap
covering the summit of the highland between Frobisher bay and
Hudson strait. It is said to discharge by one small glacier into
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
a fiord on the south side of Frobisher bay, but the ice from it
rarely breaks off as icebergs.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Shore of Cumberland Gulf From Blacklead Island.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The northern land between Admiralty and Navy Board
inlets is ice-covered, with glaciers filling its seaward valleys,
and with the separating rocky ridges rising dark and forbidding
from the general field of white. A thin ice-cap covers the
northern part of the limestone plateau on the east side of Prince
Regent inlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The western interior of the northern half of Baffin island is
described by the Eskimos as a rough plain, probably less than
1,000 feet in elevation, diversified by rolling hills with
numerous lakes in the valleys between. This country is well
covered with an Arctic vegetation which provides food for large
bands of barren-ground caribou.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two large lakes in the lower country of the southwestern
part of the island called Nettilling and Amadjuak;
both are upwards of a hundred miles long, and the low lands
surrounding them are the favourite feeding grounds for large
bands of barren-ground caribou. The natives from Cumberland
gulf, Frobisher bay and the north shores of Hudson strait resort
to the shores of these lakes annually to slaughter large numbers
of these animals for food and for their skins, which are used
for winter clothing and bedding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bylot island lies to the northeast of Baffin, being separated
from the latter by the Ponds and Navy Board inlets. It is
roughly circular in outline, with a diameter of nearly ninety
miles. In physical character it closely resembles the northeastern
part of Baffin, already described, being formed from
crystalline rocks. The general elevation of the interior ranges
from 2,000 to 3,000 feet, and the coastal highlands are covered
with an ice-cap which extends ten or fifteen miles inland, the
interior, according to the Eskimos, being free of snow during
the summer. The ice-rim feeds numerous glaciers, some of
which discharge bergs.

<h2>ISLANDS OF GROUP III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>As has been already stated, the islands of this group can only
be reached with considerable difficulty on account of their position.
Little is known of them beyond the outline of their shores,
and even these have not been fully traced in the case of the more
western islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>North Somerset, separated from the northern part of Baffin
by Prince Regent inlet, is the best known of the group, and its
northern and eastern shores have long been resorts of the
whalers in their search for the valuable Right whale in the
adjoining waters. The less valuable white whales are often
abundant along these shores, and are taken by the whalers when
the larger whales cannot be obtained. The greatest length of
this island is from north to south, being 140 miles, while its
extreme breadth in the northern part is about a hundred miles.
In shape it somewhat resembles a ham with the shank to the
southward, where the narrow Bellot strait separates it from
Boothia peninsula, a northern extension of the continent, remarkable
for containing the North Magnetic Pole within its
area. The northern coast of North Somerset is formed of limestone
cliffs; these are lower and less abrupt than on the northern
Baffin coast, while the bays indenting them are wider and not
so long as is usual on such coasts. Along the eastern side the
cliffs rise nearly 1,000 feet directly from the sea. To the south,
along this shore, the cliffs gradually decline, until the low lands
about Creswell bay are passed, when the country again becomes
high and the coast bold. The western side of the island, facing
on Peel sound, is occupied by a wide strip of Archæan rocks,
and the physical character corresponds to that of other like
areas. This coast never rises above the 1,000 feet contour, and
towards the south is considerably lower. There does not appear
to be any continuous ice-cap upon North Somerset, and the
glacial conditions are confined to isolated snow patches, with
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
small glaciers in some of the larger valleys. These glaciers do
not discharge icebergs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Prince of Wales island is separated from North Somerset by
the narrow channel of Peel sound and Franklin strait. It is
irregular in shape, being broken by a number of large bays. The
greatest length, 175 miles, is from north to south, while the
broadest part is 125 miles across. The northeast corner is occupied
by crystalline rocks, the remainder being of limestone. In
no place does the elevation of the interior plain exceed 500
feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>King William island lies to the southward of Prince of Wales
island in an angle formed by the northern coast of the continent
and Boothia peninsula. It is described as a low barren island
of limestone, of triangular shape, with a base seventy miles long
on the northwest side, the other sides having each a length of
nearly one hundred miles. The island is noted for the discovery
on its shores of the bodies of several of the ill-fated members of
Franklin’s expedition, together with the record of Franklin’s
death and the crushing of the ships in the heavy ice off the
northwest coast of the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Victoria island is the third largest of the Arctic archipelago,
its area being 74,400 square miles. Only the western
and southern shores of this great island have been explored, and
practically nothing is known of its interior. It is 450 miles
long from northwest to southeast, and is over 300 miles across
in the widest part. With the exception of a small area in the
northwest, it is formed of Silurian limestone. The island is
generally level, the greater part of it being well below an elevation
of 500 feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Banks island is the most western of this group; it is separated
from Victoria by the narrow Prince of Wales strait. Its
greatest length from northeast to southwest is about 250 miles,
while the average breadth is about 120 miles. The island is
formed largely of the softer rocks of the Carboniferous, and is
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
considerably higher than those to the eastward, the greater part
of the interior being above 1,000 feet, while in the southern
part the plateau reaches an altitude of 3,000 feet. The soil
from the Carboniferous rocks being richer and deeper than that
on the bare limestone islands, supports a good growth of arctic
vegetation, and in consequence the valleys leading to the coast
are the feeding grounds of large bands of musk-oxen, barren-ground
caribou and arctic hares, this abundance of animal life
being in marked contrast to that on the barren limestone islands.
The lowlands bordering the sea in the northwest part of the
island are formed of Miocene-Tertiary deposits, containing
numerous trees allied to those now covering the wooded northern
parts of the mainland, far to the southward. The presence of
these trees shows that, in the period before the Ice-age, the
climate of these northern islands must have been much warmer
than at present.</p>

<h2>ISLANDS OF GROUP IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The island of Ellesmere is only second in size to Baffin island,
and is remarkable for its north end extending to beyond the
eighty-third parallel of N. latitude, or to within 500 miles of
the North Pole. Its length from north to south covers nearly
seven degrees of latitude, or approximately 500 miles; its
greatest breadth across the northern part exceeds 200 miles.
Being deeply indented by large bays both on its east and west
sides, its outline is quite irregular. Smith sound, and its northern
extensions Kennedy and Robeson channels, separate the
eastern shores of Ellesmere from the northern part of Greenland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general elevation of the island is high, and probably
exceeds 2,500 feet. In the northern part the United States
mountains are upwards of 4,000 feet high, while isolated peaks
of this range reach a height of almost 5,000 feet. It is remarkable
that this high northern land is not covered with a
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
continuous ice-cap, but this is probably due to the small precipitation
of moisture derived from the ice-covered northern seas.
The first large ice-cap is situated in the interior, to the south of
81° N. latitude, and extends southward to 79° N. latitude,
where an area of lower lands occurs near the junction of the
Palæozoic rocks of the north and the Archæan of the southeast.
The southeastern quarter of the island occupied by crystalline
rocks has a general elevation of 3,000 feet or over, and is
covered by a great ice-cap, with numerous glaciers discharging
from it into the eastern bays. A great thickness of Palæozoic
extending upwards from the Silurian to the Carboniferous
occupies the southwest quarter of the island, where the rocks
rise abruptly to a tableland with an elevation of nearly 3,000
feet. The cliffs of the southern coast are indented by many long
narrow fiords. Along the western side of the island is a wide
margin of softer Mesozoic rocks which form low plains extending
from the seashore several miles inland to the base of the
high cliffs of older rocks. These plains are covered with arctic
vegetation. Musk-oxen, barren-ground caribou and arctic hares
are found there in large numbers, along with geese and other
aquatic birds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>North Devon island lies to the south of Ellesmere, being
separated from it by Jones sound; Lancaster sound bounds it
on the south. The island, in shape, somewhat resembles a
swimming bird with the head to the northwest and the body
east and west. The body is about 220 miles long and averages
seventy-five miles across. Grinnell peninsula forms the head,
the neck being very irregular, and nearly pierced through by
several long bays; the length of head and neck is a hundred
miles. The eastern third of the island is composed of crystalline
rocks, and rises to an irregular ice-clad tableland some
3,000 feet in altitude. The rise to the interior is somewhat
abrupt, and the landscape, seen from the sea, shows an interior
ice-cap in the distance, with bare rocky hills rising irregularly
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>
above the slopes of the glaciers flowing down the valleys to the
sea. The western part of the island is formed of limestone, and
is a flat tableland cut by deep narrow fiords that extend inland
many miles from the coast, and are continued beyond the salt
water as the valleys of small rivers. The general elevation of
the tableland in the eastern part is nearly 2,000 feet, but
this decreases in the westward, so that on the west side the
cliffs are below, and in the interior not much above, a thousand
feet. The eastern part of this limestone plateau is covered, at
least along the coast, by an ice-cap, and a few small glaciers
discharge from it directly into the sea. The ice-cap retreats
from the fore part of the plateau, and finally disappears before
the western shores of the island is reached. There is lower land
along the west side of the island, where there is a good growth
of arctic plants on which large numbers of musk-oxen feed,
together with some barren-ground caribou and arctic hares.
The Eskimos from northern parts of Baffin island often cross
Lancaster sound to hunt these animals on the western side of
North Devon. Walrus and white bears are also plentiful
amongst the ice of Wellington channel which separates North
Devon from Cornwallis island on the west. Sverdrup found the
remains of Eskimo encampments everywhere along the west
side of Ellesmere, and speculated as to where the people who
made them came from, and also how the Eskimos reached Greenland.
The knowledge that the Baffin natives cross to North
Devon, and that some of them have joined the arctic highlanders
of Smith sound, disposes of these speculations. Their
road is across Prince Regent inlet from Baffin to North Somerset,
thence across Lancaster sound to the western part of North
Devon. The west side of that island is followed north to the
narrows of the western part of Jones sound, and a crossing
then made to the western side of Ellesmere, where game is
plentiful. This coast of plenty would be followed northward
to Bay fiord, where the natural pass across Ellesmere would
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
lead to the fiords of the east side of the island a short distance
to the north of Cape Sabine, a place frequently visited by
the north Greenland natives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Parry islands—Cornwallis, Bathurst, Melville, Eglinton
and Prince Patrick—all lie immediately north of the western
extension of Lancaster sound—known in parts as Barrow strait,
Melville sound and McClure strait. These islands were first
discovered by Parry in 1819, but it was the diligent search
parties for Franklin that minutely investigated their shores,
making them the best known of all the Arctic islands. With the
exception of the southern part of Cornwallis, which is formed
from Silurian limestone, these islands are composed of softer
bedded rocks of the Devonian and Carboniferous. They possess
the same physical characteristics, and a general description
answers for all. The shore-lines are very broken, being deeply
cut by long irregular shaped bays. The land rises in cliffs from
400 feet to 700 feet high, to a plateau broken by many cross
ravines, which render travel in the interior difficult. The
general level of the interior is under 1,000 feet, and only rarely
does it rise above that altitude. In many places coal has been
found outcropping in the face of the cliffs of all the islands west
of Cornwallis. The practical impossibility of reaching these
coal fields precludes them from being counted among the economic
resources of Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Sverdrup islands include Axel Heiberg, Amund Ringes,
Ellef Ringes, King Christian and North Cornwall. With the
exception of the last named, these islands were discovered by
the Norwegian expedition on the <span class='it'>Fram</span> in 1899-1902. They
form a group lying to the west of Ellesmere and to the north of
the Parry islands. The largest, Axel Heiberg, lies close to the
west side of Ellesmere, and has the same physical characters
as those of the western side of the great island; these are high
lands in the interior, composed of bedded rocks, and eruptives
with low, wide foreshore, where game is plentiful.
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The other islands of the group, being formed of the softer
rocks of the Mesozoic, are lower in general elevation, and are
characterized by wide stretches of low land between the sea and
the crumbling cliffs, which rise to the uneven interior plateau,
that rarely exceeds 700 feet in elevation.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>ESKIMOS.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos are a circumpolar race, and live in the treeless
areas of the northern parts of America and Greenland.
Their present southern limit, on the Atlantic coast of Labrador,
is Hamilton inlet, in 54° N. latitude. From there they inhabit
the coast to Hudson strait, and thence along the east coast of
Hudson bay, as far south as Cape Jones, at the entrance to
James bay. On the west side of Hudson bay their southern
limit is much farther north, being at Churchill, in 57° 30´ N.
latitude. Northward of that place they are found at intervals
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
along the entire northern coast of the continent to Alaska. A
large number inhabit Baffin island and Nottingham island. The
west part of Hudson strait is peopled by a band of these natives,
while occasional small parties cross Lancaster sound to North
Devon island, and, continuing northward, come in contact with
the natives of north Greenland at Smith sound. To the westward
of Hudson bay, the Eskimos are mostly confined to the
continent, and only make occasional visits to the southern shores
of the large islands off the Arctic coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A considerable number of Eskimos, forming small communities,
inhabit the east coast of Greenland from its southern end
up to Melville bay, where a stretch of uninhabited coast occurs
between the southern settlements and the home of the arctic
highlanders at Smith sound, there forming the most northern
permanent settlement of the human race. This is on the east
side of the sound, between 74° and 77° N. latitude, or from
Cape York to the southern side of the great Humboldt glacier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time of the European discovery of the northern parts
of America, the Eskimos extended along the coasts considerably
south of their present limits. They occupied the
entire Atlantic coast of Labrador, and lived far along the north
shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Eskimos and Indians
have always been open enemies. With the advent of the whites,
the Indians soon became possessed of firearms, which gave them
a great advantage over their northern foes, who were compelled
to retreat beyond the tree-limit in the northern regions; here
they were safe, as the Indians cannot live without firewood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos continued to inhabit the eastern part of the
shore of the gulf of St. Lawrence until about 1630, when they
were expelled by the French and Indians. Captain W. Coats,
in his notes on Hudson bay, states that in 1748 the Iroquois
sent to the Indians of the bay for captive Eskimos, to be used
as human sacrifices at some great feast; that the chief of the
northern Indians proceeded forthwith on the war-path against
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>
the Eskimos capturing seven and killing thirteen; the captives
were sent south to the land of the Iroquois in what is now New
York State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1770-72, Samuel Hearne accompanied a band of Chippewyan
Indians on a journey from Churchill to the mouth of the
Coppermine river. These Indians were only induced to go to
the Arctic coast on the chance of killing Eskimos. This they
did, by surprising a band busily engaged in fishing at the first
fall above the mouth of the river, massacring them all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This warfare appears to have continued until the Eskimos
obtained firearms, when, the conditions becoming equal, the
Indians soon found that the pleasure of the Eskimo chase did
not compensate for the danger incurred, and, for many years
past, active hostilities have ceased, though the two races are still
unfriendly, and rarely, or never, intermarry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Scattered over such a wide area of country, with such poor
means of communication, it naturally follows that the Eskimo
race is broken up into a number of tribes, distinguished by difference
in dialect, and by slight differences in manners and
customs. But these are so surprisingly few, considering the
conditions, that an Eskimo from the Atlantic coast has no difficulty
in conversing with the natives of the west coast of Hudson
bay, or with those of Greenland. Their religious beliefs and
ceremonies are also wonderfully alike everywhere, and only
minor differences are to be seen in their sleds, boats, tents and
implements of the chase, these being largely due to the materials
used. In fact so close are the essential resemblances that a
description of the language, manners and customs of any tribe
requires only slight modifications to suit those of the other
tribes.</p>

<h2>DISTRIBUTION AND NUMBERS OF THE CENTRAL ESKIMOS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Franz Boas, who has devoted much attention to the study
of the Eskimos, has named those of the eastern half of the continent
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>
the Central Eskimos, to distinguish them from the
natives of Greenland and from those of the western Arctic coast
and Alaska.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following divisions are taken from Boas, with such
modifications as have been found necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The numbers of the different divisions are in many instances
only approximate, as it is exceedingly difficult to arrive at a
correct census, even when actually on the ground, owing to the
lack of appreciation of the natives of numbers and to their want
of interest in such investigations.</p>

</div>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the above table, it will be seen that the total Eskimo
population of the eastern half of Arctic America ranges between
3,400 and 3,700 individuals. These people are scattered along
the coasts of the mainland and northern islands, while a few
live continuously inland to the west of Hudson bay. The present
northern limit of permanent settlement of the Eskimos, in
eastern Canada, is Lancaster sound and its western extensions,
in about 74° N. latitude. Many traces of their habitations have
been found on the islands north of Lancaster sound, and far
north along the west side of Ellesmere island, but these only
represent the temporary quarters of stragglers from the south,
who return after a short sojurn in the north.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the west side of Hudson bay the natives extend southward
to the neighbourhood of Churchill, the most southern tribe being
the Padlimiut, who inhabit the country northward from
Churchill to Ranken inlet, and inland in a northwest direction
along the edge of the forest-line to about the latitude of Ranken
inlet. Their northern neighbours are the Kenipitumiut, who
occupy the territory about Chesterfield inlet and along the rivers
tributary to that great bay. The Kenipitumiut are not very
numerous, and, according to Captain George Comer, who has
made a very careful census of the natives of the west part of
Hudson bay, they only number 140 persons. The Aivillingmiut
are next northward, and are more confined to the coast than the
southern natives; they consequently depend largely on the sea
animals for food and clothing, the southern people living mostly
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
on the barren-ground caribou. The Aivilliks are scattered along
the coast from Cape Fullerton to Repulse bay. These are the
natives employed by the American whalers to assist in the whaling
industry, and who in consequence are more civilized than
their neighbours north and south. From long contact with the
whalers, there is an admixture of white blood in this tribe,
although half-breeds usually die young. The tribe has contracted
some of the loathsome diseases of civilization. They at
present number 138 persons, and the population now appears
to be nearly stationary, though there was a considerable decrease
for some years after the whaling vessels first frequented the bay
and before the tribe became accustomed to the changes involved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Iglulingmiut are a small tribe occupying the east shore
of Fox channel, from Repulse bay northward to Fury and Hecla
strait, and were the tribe met with and described by Parry, who
wintered among them in 1821-22. According to Captain Comer
they now number only sixty persons, and are not increasing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nechillingmiut are the most numerous tribe to the westward
of Hudson bay, and number about 450 persons. They
inhabit the country to the westward of the Igluliks and Aivilliks,
extending westward and northward to Back river and the
shores and islands of the Arctic sea. The Sinimiut were a small
independent tribe, living about the southern shores of Committee
bay, but they have now been absorbed into the Nechilliks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another small inland tribe is the Shaunuktungmiut, who
occupy territory to the southwest of Chesterfield inlet. Little
is known about this people, except that they are a small tribe
allied to the Kenipitumiut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Coming to the natives of Baffin island, the Nugumiut tribe
inhabit the country about Frobisher bay, and at present have
their headquarters at the whaling settlement at Cape Haven,
being employed about the station, during the periods of open
water, in chasing whales, walrus and seals. Their number is
sufficient to man four whaleboats, requiring about twenty able-bodied
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
men, and the total population does not exceed 120

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Eskimos at Blacklead, Cumberland Gulf.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The natives of Cumberland gulf congregate about the whaling
stations of Kekerten and Blacklead, where they are
employed for a large part of the year by the whalers. According
to the Rev. Mr. Peck, who has now resided several years among
them, the total population numbers about 380 souls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natives living on the north side of Hudson strait are not
numerous, and are split up into three tribes. The Sikosilingmiut
live in the inland region of King Charles cape, at the
eastern entrance to Fox channel. A number of families from
this tribe crossed a few years ago to Nottingham island, and are
living there now, having been visited in 1901, when they were
found to be without firearms, and were killing deer by chasing
them with dogs and shooting them with bow and arrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Akolingmiut tribe reside in the neighbourhood of Big
island, in the central part of the north shore of Hudson strait.
These are among the oldest known Eskimos and came in contact
with the earliest white explorers of Hudson bay. Old writers
mention their filthy habits, and the present generation appears
to keep up the reputation of their ancestors, as being the most
degraded of all the tribes. For a number of years the American
whalers had a station on the coast, at Spicer harbour, some
miles to the westward of Big island, but it has long been
abandoned. At present the Scotch whaling steamer <span class='it'>Active</span>
enters the bay annually, and on arriving at Big island takes
on board the entire tribe, after which the ship proceeds to
the whaling and walrus grounds of Fox channel and Roes Welcome,
where the men are employed in the chase of these animals.
A few years ago the firm to which the <span class='it'>Active</span> belongs established
a station on the south side of Southampton, and imported a
number of the Big island natives. These natives, being provided
with modern rifles, soon killed off or frightened away the deer
in the neighbourhood. The old inhabitants of the island
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
(Sagdlingmiut) being armed only with bow and arrows and
spears, were unable to compete with the better armed strangers,
and as a result the entire tribe, who numbered 68 souls in 1900,
died of starvation and disease during the winter of 1902. The
whaling station was abandoned in the summer of 1903, after
the death of the original natives, and the great island is now
uninhabited except by a few natives from Big island who stay
at the old whaling station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The white men belonging to the whaling station have now
been quartered at Repulse bay, and a number of the Big island
natives have also been taken there; it is likely, therefore, that
they will spread disease and disaster among the Aivilliks and
Nechilliks of that region. Some regulation should be made to
prevent this unauthorized movement of the natives, or similar
wholesale slaughter will again occur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos of the Atlantic coast of Labrador have long
been under the direct influence of the Moravian missionaries,
and are in consequence much more civilized than the others.
The Moravians first arrived on the coast in 1770, and since then
have established mission stations along the shores from Hamilton
inlet northward to Cape Chidley. Their policy has been
to collect the natives into bands about these stations. To accomplish
this, they have erected each mission at some place where
the natural resources are abundant. The missionaries have
kept the Eskimos as free as possible from contact with the floating,
white, fishing population, and to do so, have obtained
exclusive trading rights from the Newfoundland Government.
Their scheme is a sort of parent-hood, by which they supply the
natives with food and clothing, taking the product of their hunt
in exchange; this scheme seems to work very satisfactorily, the
natives being content, while their welfare is attended to without
their being pauperized. There is no premium put on laziness
and false piety, as is so often the case where the missionary
makes a free distribution of food and clothing to the natives.
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
Then it often happens that the good, industrious hunter, who
goes away from the station to provide for his family, receives
none of the gifts, which are given to the shiftless individuals
who hang about the station in a state of pious poverty. The
Moravian Eskimos must provide for themselves by work of one
kind or another, and the shiftless ones only receive sufficient
to keep life going, without any of its luxuries. These people
have all been taught to read and write, there being a number of
books printed in the language; the majority of these are of a
religious character, but there are some on geography, history
and other secular subjects, so that all the natives have a fair
knowledge of the outside world. From their long contact with
the missionaries, they are devout Christians, have completely
lost many of their ancient beliefs and customs, and now conform
closely to the manners and customs of civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natives of Cape Chidley, some half-dozen families, have
for a few years been under the care of the Rev. Mr. Stewart.
He has had some difficulty instilling the Christian doctrines,
and in weaning them from their ancient customs and beliefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos of Ungava bay and the south shore of Hudson
strait are still without knowledge of Christianity, beyond what
has been spread by the southern Christian natives. The Eskimos
as a rule take kindly to Christianity, and follow its precepts in
a manner which shames the average white Christian. All are
exceedingly anxious to learn to read the books printed by the
Church Missionary Society. These books are printed in a
syllabic shorthand, very easy to read, and are supplied from
Great Whale river on the east side of Hudson bay, and from
Cumberland gulf. A great many Eskimos have never come in
contact with the missionaries; notwithstanding this, there are
only a few of the Labrador natives who cannot read and write,
while the natives of Baffin island are rapidly reaching the same
state. Every native who learns to read, and who possesses a
book, becomes the teacher of the uninstructed; in this manner
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>
education is spreading rapidly. A good example is found in
the natives on the northwest coast of Hudson bay, several of
whom have learned to read from the Big island natives on the
Scotch whaler, who were in turn instructed by visiting Eskimos
from Cumberland gulf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos of the east side of Hudson bay and of the
Belcher islands annually come under the teaching of the missionary
at Great Whale river, and have to a great extent
abandoned the practice of old customs and beliefs. The only
custom that they cling tenaciously to is that relating to
polygamy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos of the Atlantic coast, under the control of the
Moravians, number nearly 1,000 persons. Those at Nachvak
and Cape Chidley do not exceed fifty. A few families occupy
the coast of Ungava bay from Cape Chidley to the mouth of
Koksoak river; these are engaged, during the summer, fishing
for salmon in the mouths of George and Whale rivers, there
being about a half-dozen families at each place. In 1893 there
were fifty-one families scattered along the shores of Ungava bay
from Cape Chidley to Cape Hopes Advance. Along the south
shore of Hudson strait, from Cape Hopes Advance to Cape
Weggs, live some thirty families, while to the westward of these,
as far as Cape Wolstenholme there are about seventy-five
natives living on the coast, principally in the neighbourhood of
Deception and Sugluk bays and near Cape Wolstenholme.
About one hundred more, not included in the above, live inland
and trade at Fort Chimo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The western Eskimos, who trade at Great Whale river,
number about eighty families, including a dozen families from
the Belcher islands, together with a few living about Fort
George and on the islands of James bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Allowing four or five as the size of the average family, the
total Eskimo population in the Labrador peninsula amounts to
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>
about two thousand persons, divided about equally between the
Atlantic coast and the remainder of the peninsula.</p>

<h2>ANNUAL ROUTINE.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo, even to a greater extent than the Indian,
depends upon the chase for his existence. The Indian is dependent,
in the uncivilized state, on the animals he kills for food
and clothing, while the Eskimo must not only get his sustenance
and raiment by the chase, but also his fuel, which is either
obtained from the blubber of seals and whales, or from the fat
of the barren-ground caribou.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The yearly round of life of the Eskimo differs but little anywhere,
except on the Atlantic coast of Labrador, where it has
been modified by the missionaries. A description of the annual
life of an Eskimo of the east coast of Hudson bay is typical of
that of the other tribes, and only accidental variations occur,
due to the prevalence of particular game, such as the musk-ox,
in some regions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the winter the Eskimo lives in a snowhouse or <span class='it'>iglo</span>;
in the summer in a tent or <span class='it'>tupik</span>, made of seal or deer skins.
The year begins with the lengthening days of January, and this
is usually a period of hard times, lasting for a couple of months.
The Eskimo of the southern regions is then on his yearly
journey to the trading post, where he will exchange the proceeds
of the past year’s hunt for ammunition, tobacco, and a
few luxuries of clothing and tools. The ice along the coast in
January does not extend far from the shore, and the seals keep
in the open water, where they can only be killed by being shot
from the edge of the ice. This is a very uncertain subsistence
for the native, owing to the storms of the season, which either
break the ice from the shore, or crowd its edge with small floating
cakes, forming an impassable barrier to the open water. If
a good supply of deermeat has not been laid by during the fall,
periods of starvation are now frequent; these, when severe and
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
prolonged, result in death or disaster, more natives dying at this
time than throughout the rest of the year. The annual journey
is made in stages; the native remains in a suitable spot for
killing seals until enough of these animals has been secured to
meet the requirements of food for the family and dogs, for a few
days; then everything is securely lashed on the long, narrow
sleds, and the party, usually consisting of two or more families,
travels slowly southward along the shore ice, a woman often
walking ahead of the dogs to encourage them. The men wander
about on the ice in search of seal-holes, and occasionally secure
a seal while on the journey. In the evening a halt is made, and
the men build a small snowhouse with blocks cut from a convenient
bank. These small houses, built only for the night,
seldom exceed nine or ten feet in diameter, and it is only when
a considerable stay is expected that larger houses are built.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Labrador Eskimos rarely live more than one family in a
house, but on the west shore of Hudson bay and at Cumberland
gulf two or more families often live together, either in connected
houses or in a single large house. The largest single
house, seen by the writer, at Cape Fullerton, was twenty-seven
feet in diameter and twelve feet from the floor to the centre of
the dome; it was inhabited by four families. This house was
too large for the material, and the roof had to be supported by
props shortly after being built; but several others, eighteen feet
in diameter, showed no signs of such weakness.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/142a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_142' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Snowhouses at Fullerton.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo first tests the snow of the neighbouring banks by
probing with his long snow-knife, often a twelve-inch butcher
knife, and when he finds a bank formed by the drift of
a single storm, he cuts an oblong hole about five feet long, two
or three feet wide, and about twenty inches deep, with a clean
face on one of the longer sides. He next cuts blocks from this
face; these blocks are about five or six inches thick, from
twenty-four to thirty inches long and twenty inches deep. A
line the width of the block is first drawn on the surface, then
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>
cuts are made at the ends and bottom of the block, after which
the knife is thrust down several times along the rear line and
the block is wedged off. One man usually cuts blocks, while
another builds the house. A circle the size of the intended
house is traced on the surface of the snow, and the first circle
of blocks arranged around it. When this is completed, the first
few blocks are cut down diagonally, so that the next layer of
blocks will take a spiral form and continue to wind in a decreasing
curve until the dome is closed by an irregular key-block.
This manner of building is superior to a succession of lessening
circles, as each block is so cut as to be held by the one placed
immediately before, and thus one man only is needed at the
work, whereas, if the circular method were used, the different
blocks of the circle would require to be held in place until the
circle was complete. The finished house is a snow-dome of about
two-thirds the height of the diameter of the base, with the arch
flattened towards the summit. When all the blocks are in place,
the cracks between them are chinked with loose snow, generally
by the women. A line of blocks is then placed across the centre
of the floor-space opposite to where the door will be, with other
blocks at right angles to thus reduce the floor-space to a rectangle
extending from the door to the centre of the <span class='it'>iglo</span>. On the far
side of these walls, blocks of snow are thrown, and cut to form a
smooth platform about eighteen inches higher than the original
floor; this forms the bed of the family, while the side platforms
hold the camp and cooking utensils. A door is now cut in the
wall opposite the bed; it is about thirty inches high and eighteen
inches wide, and passes into a tunnel porch several feet long
and somewhat larger than the door, built later, and serves
as a shelter for the dogs. When the house is permanent, the
porch is built with two or more lobes with doors at each contraction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the men are finishing the porch and other work
outside, the women take the bedding and household goods from
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>
the sled and put the house in order for the night. The bed is
formed by laying, upon the snow, mats of closely woven branches
of a small willow, which separate the deerskins from the snow.
The bedding is composed of several thicknesses of deerskins,
dressed with the hair on; these completely prevent any cold
from penetrating from below. On the bed thus formed rest the
deerskin sleeping bags, which are only closed for about a third
of the length at the bottom, or not at all. The lamp is next put
in position, on the shelf at one side of the house between the
door and bed. It is made of stone, and rests upon three or four
short sticks thrust into the snow. When the soapstone, out of
which the lamp is usually made, cannot be obtained, any other
easily worked rock is used. On top the lamp is roughly triangular
in outline, the sides of the triangle being long concave
curves. There is one long side and two equal short ones which
meet each other in a wide angle; this results in a triangle with
a base about twice the length of the vertical. The length varies
from ten inches to more than thirty inches, eighteen being an
ordinary length. The upper surface of the lamp is slightly
hollowed to form a receptacle for the blubber and oil. The lower
side is curved so that the lamp has a thickness varying from an
inch to two inches. The lamp is fed with seal blubber, or deer
fat; the former most commonly. The blubber is cut in thin
strips, partly suspended above the lamp on a stick, and a part
of it bruised to start the extraction of the oil. A wick of dry,
pulverized moss is placed around the edge of the lamp, and
squeezed deftly into shape by the finger and thumb, after being
moistened in the blubber. When the wick has been properly
arranged, it is usually set alight with an ordinary match, or
with a flint and steel, iron pyrites often taking the place of flint.
The old usage of making fire by friction is seldom employed,
and only in the case of the absence of the easier methods. At
first the flame from the lamp is small, but the heat soon warms
up the stone, and the blubber melts without much attention. As
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
the flame increases the wick requires considerable manipulation
so that the flame may burn evenly around the lamp and not
cause smoke.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/144a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_144' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Interior of Snowhouse at Fullerton.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The more remote Eskimos suspend an oblong kettle of soapstone
over the flame to melt ice and cook food, but most of the
natives, having access to traders, have largely given up the use
of the stone kettle and use tin ones in its place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cooked food, with its accompanying broths, is preferred to
raw, but the Eskimos are not averse to raw meat, especially
liver, the fat portions of the deer and all fish during the winter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While the women are arranging the interior of the snowhouse,
the men are busy unharnessing the dogs, feeding them
with large lumps of seal or other meat, or with fish, which the
dogs devour ravenously after their twenty-four hours’ fast. The
harness and other things liable to be eaten by the dogs are either
hung out of reach or taken into the house. If the night is
stormy a couple of blocks of snow are put to windward of the
hole from which they are taken, thus making a shelter for each
dog. Many of the dogs disdain such shelter, and on the coldest
stormy nights lie curled upon the highest place available, evidently
preferring the cold to being drifted under by the snow
in the holes prepared for them. The Eskimo, as a rule, is very
considerate to his dogs, and only treats them violently at rare
intervals. Then he uses the long heavy dog-whip to some purpose,
and the dogs retain for all time the remembrance of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When more than one family live in a house, each has its independent
lamp, and the family cooking is kept separate. Seals
and other food are, to some extent, common property; that is,
if an Eskimo kills an animal when alone, he divides it amongst
his neighbours, who return the compliment. When hunting in
company the customs vary with the animal killed and with the
tribes; there is a great deal of etiquette observed, and as a rule
each member of the party is entitled to some portion of the
carcass.
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The dog-sled on the east coast of Hudson bay, where driftwood
is abundant, varies in length from twelve to twenty feet,
sixteen feet being an average length. The runner is usually
formed of one piece the length of the sled, but in the north,
where wood is very scarce, the sled is shorter, and the runners
are frequently formed of two or more pieces spliced and lashed
together with seal line. Where wood cannot be obtained, whalebones
form a substitute, and even ice is sometimes used as sled-runners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The runners vary from two to three inches in thickness, and
are four to eight inches deep. They are placed about fifteen
inches apart, thus forming a long narrow sled. They are joined
by a number of cross-bars, which vary from three to six inches
in width and are about an inch thick. They are placed close
together when possible, and cover the space between the runners
extending from the rear end for two-thirds the length of the
sled. These cross-pieces are securely lashed to the runners with
seal-line, no nails being used in the construction of the sled.
The ends of the bars project a short distance outside the
runners, and are there nicked for the lash-line with which the
load is secured to the sled. The runners are shod with ivory,
bone from the jaw of the whale, or with hoop iron or steel.
Shoeing made of pieces of walrus ivory is most prized. The
ivory is cut into slabs about a half an inch thick; holes are bored
through the slabs at intervals of about an inch, and the slabs
are attached to the runner by wooden pegs through these holes.
The slabs are rarely more than eight inches long, and a great
deal of ingenuity is often displayed in the fitting of them to
cover the bottom of the runner. An ivory-shod sled is one
the most valuable possessions of an Eskimo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When whalebone is used it is attached to the runner in the
same manner as ivory; that is, with small wooden pegs, but the
slabs of bone are usually several feet in length. Iron or steel
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>
are bad substitutes for bone or ivory, as they offer much more
friction in cold weather when the snow is fine and gritty.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/146a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_146' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Loaded Sleds from Chesterfield Inlet.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>During the period of intense cold, lasting from December to
April, the shoeing of the sled is of mud or lichens, frozen over
the regular shoeing. The best material for this purpose is the
dark brown peaty muck formed from the decay of mosses in
swamps. Where this cannot be obtained, the white reindeer
moss is mixed to a thick paste with water. This shoeing is
attached to the runners in the following manner:—when cotton
rags are available, these are wetted and frozen to the bottom of
the runner, so as to cover the shoeing and extend a couple of
inches up both sides of the runner. The muck, which has been
boiled to a thick paste, is then applied warm over the cloth, and
is roughly shaped by hand, so as to have a thickness of about an
inch, with a section resembling the bulb of a heavy steel rail.
After being roughly shaped, the muck is allowed to freeze hard,
when it is worked over with a wood plane, and the inequalities
are reduced to a smooth surface. It is then covered with a thin
film of ice, either by lightly running a rag wet with warm fresh
water over the surface, or by squirting a small even stream from
the mouth. Great care is taken to have the iceing uniform, and
every portion of the muck covered. This coating of ice is
renewed every morning, and a sled so shod slips over the intensely
cold snow with much less friction than when shod in
any other known manner. As the weather gets warmer this
muck is removed, and the ivory, bone or iron shoeing used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The number of dogs in the team varies from eight to two or
three, an average team being six. Each dog has a separate trace.
The harness is formed of two loops of sealskins, which pass
under the forelegs, and are sewn together on the breast and
joined by a strip about four inches long over the shoulders, thus
forming an opening for the head. The loops are brought together
in the middle of the back, and the trace is there attached
to their united ends.   The trace is made of a single length of
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
line cut from the skin of the Big seal (<span class='it'>Phoca barbata</span>), and
varies in length from ten to thirty feet. The traces are regulated
in length, so that the dogs when pulling straight ahead have
the leading dog about two yards in advance, and the others in
pairs about a yard behind each other. The traces are made long
in order that the dogs may not be massed in passing rough or
thin ice, and for the same reason the traces are not fastened to
the front of the sled, but to a loop of walrus line which is attached
at the first bar, or nearly a third of the length back. By
this means the sled is easily turned, and allowed to run at a
considerable angle to the direction in which the dogs are travelling;
advantage is thus taken of the smoothest places when
journeying along the broken ice piled upon the shores. The use
of individual traces is not without its drawbacks. While
travelling the dogs constantly cross from side to side among
themselves, and weave their traces into a single rope. Stops
must be made every few hours to untangle the traces. The long
trace is also constantly fouling hummocks while passing over
rough ice; when this occurs the dog is pulled back to the sled by
the fouled trace, and if he does not get hurt physically, at least
his pride is offended, so that, when freed, he usually has a little
unpleasantness with every dog he passes to regain his place in
the team. The leading dog answers more or less satisfactorily
to the word of command, and is followed by the other dogs.
The usual commands are to swing right or left, to start and to
stop. The dogs are very acute of hearing, and the words are
usually given in a low tone. When a dog is to receive punishment
he is pulled back in the team and his shortened trace made
fast to the sled; the driver can then give his undivided attention
to the whip. A great deal of dexterity is shown in using the
whip, and a lot of time is spent practising with it. A good whip
handler knows at least four or five different cuts, and can hit
within an inch or so anywhere inside the length of the long lash.
The blow is terrific.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>A Small Team and a Heavy Load.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>When an Eskimo leaves a snow-house, his household goods
are removed by breaking a hole in the side of the wall. They
are then loaded on the sled, and retained by cross-lashings of
sealskin passed from side to side, where they are secured in the
niches of the cross-bars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the ice has frozen several miles out from the shore
many of the seals remain in the shallow waters of the bays and
sounds. In order to do this they are compelled to keep holes
open so that they may breathe from time to time. They form
these holes either by enlarging natural cracks or, when such do
not occur, by scraping with their front flippers a conical hole
big enough to admit their body and with a few inches to spare
at the surface. As the time approaches to bring forth her
young, the female enlarges a hole, usually in rough ice where
the snow is deeply drifted, and there clears away the snow about
the hole, forming a flat-domed house sufficiently large to accommodate
herself and her young. The pups are born in March and
April. A seal does not necessarily confine itself to one or more
breathing holes of its own, but uses those of other seals, so that
the chances of killing a seal at any particular hole varies. The
Eskimo now forsakes the edge of the floe and hunts his seals
at these holes. In order to find the holes he employs his keenest
scented dog, harnessed, who soon smells a hole and rushes to it
dragging his master with him. If the hole appears well frequented,
and the Eskimo is anxious to obtain a seal, he takes
the dog some distance away and ties him securely by his trace
to the ice. He then returns to the hole, and clears the snow
from about its opening, replacing it with a fresh thin slab, on
which the centre of the hole is plainly marked. If he intends
to remain until a seal comes, he often erects a low wall of snow
to windward, and sometimes places a block close to the hole as
a seat. A piece of deer or bear skin is put down to stand on; he
then ties a thong around his legs at the knees so that they may
make no noise by striking together when shivering with the
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>
cold. All preparations being complete, he stands or sits absolutely
motionless for hours until a seal comes to the hole to
breathe. The slightest movement or noise made as the seal
approaches raises suspicion and the animal goes elsewhere. The
near approach is heralded by strings of bubbles formed by the
animal emptying its lungs as it rises to the hole. When its
nostrils are above the water and it begins a series of long
inspirations, the Eskimo noiselessly brings his spear directly
over the centre of the hole, and strikes down with his full
strength, hoping to drive the barb into the brain and immediately
kill the seal. This often happens with small ones, but
with the large ground-seal a single blow rarely kills it, and a
struggle between man and victim then takes place. The winter
seal spear is from five to six feet long. It consists of four parts,
the barb, the iron rod on which the head fits, the wooden shaft
and the iron ice-chisel at the end opposite to the spear. The
head or barb is now almost always made of iron, the ancient
ones being of stone, or iron and ivory. It is about three inches
long, and quite narrow in proportion to the length; the point is
formed into a slender barbed spear, with a small hole at its base
which fits the iron rod of the handle. Near the centre is another
hole, at right angles to the length, to which is attached several
fathoms of seal line. The rod of the shaft is from fifteen to
thirty inches long, and is usually made from three-eighths or
half-inch iron or steel. At the upper end it is pointed to fit the
hole in the base of the spearhead; at the lower end it is securely
fastened to the wooden handle by being driven into it to the
depth of three or four inches, and the end of the wood is
strongly bound with sinew. The wooden handle forms the
middle portion of the spear; it is usually about two feet long,
and of sufficient circumference to afford a strong and convenient
grasp. A small peg of ivory projects about half an inch from
the side of the wooden handle, and over this peg a small loop
attached to the spear line is passed. This keeps the line taut,
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
and holds the head securely in place on the end of the rod.
When a seal is struck the loop slips from the peg and the spearhead
is detached from the handle. In striking a seal, the handle
is held in the right hand and the line in a coil in the left. Immediately
the animal is struck the hunter lays down the handle
and devotes himself to the line. If the seal is a large one and
struggles much, a turn of the line is taken around the waist,
and the hunter braces himself for an encounter, in which the
seal is sometimes the victor. Great care is necessary in paying
out the line, for many a finger has been lost by becoming
entangled in a loop. The violently struggling seal must soon
breathe, and to do so is compelled to rise in the hole; then the
hunter endeavours to drive the pointed rod into its brain, and
usually does so very quickly. The hole is then enlarged with the
ice-chisel on the end of the spear handle. The chisel is commonly
made of half-inch square iron or steel firmly sunk into the
wooden shaft and fined down to a long chisel-edge. When the
seal has been hauled on the ice a number of ceremonies are gone
through in order to propitiate its spirit and to please the goddess
of the marine animals. One of the customs consists in bursting
the eyes so that the seal’s spirit may not see that it is being
taken to the snow-house. Of course these customs are falling
into disuse among the Christianized Eskimos of Labrador and
Cumberland gulf, but there remains, even among the most
enlightened, a strong leaven of their ancient superstitions and
customs.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Interior of Snowhouse at Fullerton.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>At every stopping place traps are set for foxes. The trap is
usually a single-spring steel one, of which each native usually
has two or three. The traps are set on the snow and covered
with a thin sheet of hard snow, the bait being hidden alongside.
Where steel traps are not available, long narrow boxes of stone
or ice are constructed, with the bait in the back part, and
attached to a dead fall, so that when it is disturbed, the door
falls upon the fox. The Arctic fox is generally plentiful in the
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
early winter months, when many of them travel southward
along the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The months of January and February are passed by the
Eskimos on the journey to the trading post, where a short stay
of a few days is made to dry the fox-skins caught during the
winter, and to trade these along with deer and other skins in
the shop. There is no cash used in these transactions; the skins
are handed over to the trader, who values them from a standard
of a white fox skin. When the amount has been made up, he
hands to the native a number of tokens representing the value
of his hunt in fox-skins. The usual tariff is about as follows:—</p>

<table id='tab6' summary='' class='center'>
<tr><td class='tab6c1 tdStyle7'>White fox = 1 skin.</td><td class='tab6c2 tdStyle7'>Mink = 1 skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab6c1 tdStyle7'>Blue fox = 2 skins.</td><td class='tab6c2 tdStyle7'>Marten = 2 skins.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab6c1 tdStyle7'>Cross fox = 5 to 15 skins.</td><td class='tab6c2 tdStyle7'>White bear = 4 to 10 skins.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab6c1 tdStyle7'>Silver fox = 15 to 40 skins.</td><td class='tab6c2 tdStyle7'>Deerskin = ½ skin.</td></tr>
<tr><td class='tab6c1 tdStyle7'>Otter = 4 to 8 skins.</td><td class='tab6c2 tdStyle7'>&nbsp;</td></tr>
</table>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo trades back, over the counter, the tokens received
for his hunt. The first purchase is a supply of tobacco; next
comes ammunition, and then follow tools, cheap clothing,
needles, tin kettles, knives, files, &amp;c., until his stock of tokens
is used up. The immediate profit on the goods supplied is very
great, but when the cost of transport and the maintenance of
the post are taken into account the profit, which appears enormous
at first, is found to be not excessive, considering the
precarious nature of the fur trade, with its fluctuating market
and the chances against good hunts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The trading completed, the natives collect in large bands on
the ice, usually in the vicinity of some long crack or other place
where seals are abundant, and spend the next month going from
encampment to encampment visiting friends and exchanging
the news. With the first signs of mild weather a start is made
northward. Life now is very pleasant; the days are long and
becoming mild; seals are killed in large numbers on the ice,
as they lie basking and sleeping in the warm sun. A good deal
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
of patience and some excellent mimicry is displayed in killing
seals at this time. When one is seen lying near its hole, the
native approaches as near as possible, say within 500 yards,
when he lies down and crawls and wriggles the remainder of
the distance. During this operation great care is taken not to
excite the animal’s suspicion, and an advance is only made
when the seal’s head is down. A seal appears to sleep in short
naps, and raises his head every few minutes; when he does so
the hunter immediately hides his face, and with his arms and
legs imitates the motions of a seal scratching or lazily rolling,
at the same time mimicking the blowing and other noises made
by the seals; by so doing he soon lulls suspicion, and is enabled
to crawl a little closer. By advancing in this manner he can
get within fifty yards of his prey, when he shoots it. When the
native has no gun, he continues to close in until sufficiently
near to kill with his lance; this must, however, be done quickly,
for the seal displays wonderful agility in falling into the water
when disturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Early in May the few families who intend to pass the
summer inland leave the coast and hurry to their destination
before the sun melts the snow. The greater number pass the
early summer on the coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the advent of June the snow begins to melt, and soon
after the land becomes bare. This is a period of trial for the
house-wife; the warmth causes the roofs of the snow-houses to
leak, and they can only be kept up by a daily patching with
loose snow, while the ground is not sufficiently bare for the erection
of the summer tent; it becomes a constant fight with the
heat and water, terminated only by the roof falling in. The
smell and general filthiness of one of these deserted spring
houses is better left to the imagination; it is indeed beyond
description. During this time, while the ice on the coast still
holds, the men are busily employed killing seals, whose skins
are needed to repair the summer tent and to cover the Eskimo’s
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
boat or kyak. The men bring in the animals and skin them,
after which the skins are handed to the women to dress.
If they are to be used to repair the tent, or for bags, they are
simply dried by stretching them on wooden pegs about six
inches above the ground. If they are required to coyer the kyak,
or for boots, the hair is scraped off with an ordinary chopping
knife, against the grain, and the film is removed from the inner
skin. For winter boots, the hair is rotted off and the skin has a
white colour, but it is not water-proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as a convenient level spot of ground is bare of snow
the snow-house is abandoned and the summer tent erected. The
tent is of a ridge-pole pattern, with the ridge from six to ten
feet long, resting in the front in the socket between two crossed
poles and at the rear terminating at the apex of a number of
poles which form a half cone to the back of the tent. The ridge
is about six or seven feet high, and the frame over all about
twelve feet long and about nine feet wide on the ground. The
covering is made either of seal or deer skins, except in the case
of a man of wealth, who has a cover of cotton. Both the seal
and deer skins used for this purpose are dressed with the hair
on, and are used with the hairy side exposed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the time to repair, and if necessary make new, wooden
frames for the kyak. The kyak is a long narrow boat sharply
pointed at both ends, and entirely decked over except a small
well sufficiently large for the entrance of a man’s body. The
frame is of wood, and is covered with sealskins sewn together
to make a water-tight cover. Each tribe has a slightly different
model, the difference being in the shape of the bow or stern or
in the relative width. The Labrador kyak, common to the
Atlantic coast and Hudson bay and strait, is nearly twenty
feet long, and over two feet wide in the middle, or well section.
It has a long sharp bow, which leaves the water about
six feet from the forward end, where it stands about fifteen
inches above the water. The stern is lower and less sharp,
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
terminating in a knob about a foot long, which projects slightly
above the water. The front of the well is situated about the
middle of the length, so that the opening is in the fore part of
the after-half of the deck. It is roughly oval in shape, and is
surrounded by a wooden combing about six inches deep, so
placed as to slope upwards towards the bow. The boat is propelled
by a narrow double paddle. The frame is made of thin
strips of wood forming the gunwales, and of five or seven additional
strips, one of which is the keelson. These are kept in
place by light ribs placed about a foot apart, with corresponding
deck beams. Considerable mechanical skill is displayed in the
making of this frame, which is all fitted together without the
use of a single nail, wooden pegs and sinew lashings being alone
used.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/154a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_154' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Eskimo Kyak off Cape Haven.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The natives about Cumberland gulf and along the west side
of Hudson bay, who are employed by the whalers, are gradually
giving up the use of the kyak, and now do their hunting and
travelling with whaleboats, which are supplied to them by the
whaling vessels. Each vessel at the end of her voyage generally
leaves all spare boats behind. These are distributed among the
natives, and the result is that nearly every family possesses a
boat. The Aivilliks and Kenipitus, of the west coast of Hudson
bay, still make use of the kyak for inland hunting, but the
Cumberland people take their whaleboats into the interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Kenipitu kyak is extraordinary in shape. It is long and
narrow and quite deep, so that the midship section is almost
semicircular. The ends terminate in long narrow points, of
which the bow end slopes downward towards the water and the
stern end is inclined upwards. This kyak is so narrow that the
combing of the well sometimes projects beyond the sides. Being
narrow and cranky, a good deal of skill is required to handle
these craft with safety, and accidents caused by upsetting are
not uncommon. These kyaks are covered with parchment deerskin,
and are the only ones painted, various colours being
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
obtained for the purpose from oxide of iron found in the
interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as the frame is complete, all the women of the encampment
join in sewing on the sealskin cover, as the operation
when started must be completed at one sitting, before the skins
dry. The seams are made with a double lap, and are quite
water-tight. The skin shrinks on drying, and becomes stretched
like a drum over the frame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natives have another boat called the umiak or woman’s
boat. This is also made with a wooden frame covered with
skins, but it is much larger than the hunting kyak of the men.
In shape it roughly resembles a large square-ended punt, being
often twenty feet and over in length, by six feet or more across
the middle section, and tapering towards the ends to about half
that width. It is made quite deep, and is capable of carrying a
very heavy load. Usually two or more families use a single
umiak to transport their goods from place to place, and as the
poles and Big sealskin covering of each tent weigh upwards of
half a ton, the capacity of these boats can be realized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The framework is heavy, and the sides are kept in place by
a number of cross thwarts, which also serve as seats for the
rowers. The covering is made from the large skins of the Big
seal (<span class='it'>Phoca barbata</span>), sewn together in a manner similar to the
covering of the kyak. This craft is rowed by the women,
usually with an old man as steersman. It is propelled by rude
oars made from small trees, the handle being formed from the
thick part, while the blades are made by attaching strips on two
sides of the smaller end. Two or more women pull each oar,
which vary in number from two to four.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only place where such boats are known by the writer to
be used is along the south side of Hudson strait and about
Ungava bay. Elsewhere the whaleboat has been found more
convenient, and when the planking is worn out they are covered
with sealskin.
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>During the month of June the weather is generally fine, and
ducks and geese are plentiful in the open water of the ponds
and sea. The ice becomes very rotten towards the end of the
month, and soon after breaks away from the shores, when the
kyaks come into use. This is the most pleasant season of the
year for the Eskimos, and they always sing about its pleasures
in their sing-songs to be described later. Game of all kinds is
abundant; the deer come to the coast at this season; seals are
plentiful in the open water, and walruses are floating about on
the loose ice; the Arctic salmon swarm in the shallow water
along the coast, and thousands of eggs of the sea fowl may be
collected from any of the smaller outer islands. A little later
the white porpoise enters the mouths of the larger rivers in
schools, and is killed with the harpoon and gun from the kyaks.
The summer harpoon differs from the winter one, in that the
iron work of the latter is replaced by ivory obtained from walrus
tusks. The handle is stout, and made of wood from four
to six feet long; at one end it is tipped with ivory, with a cone-like
socket in its upper side, into which a similar cone on the
lower end of the ivory shaft fits. The two are joined together
by a thong of seal-line passing through holes in the ivory of
each piece about two inches from their ends. This thong is
made tight, and holds the cones in place while the harpoon is in
use and until the head enters some animal, when the weight of
the shaft causes the cones to slip and the shaft hangs loose from
the wooden handle. The shaft is usually made from a single
tusk, and is from twelve to eighteen inches long, but sometimes
it is made by splicing two pieces, and they are joined by bands
of lead run through mortised holes in the two pieces. The shaft
in its lower end at the cone is usually over an inch in diameter,
and tapers slowly to the upper end, where it is about a quarter
of an inch thick. There is generally the natural curve of the
tusk in the shaft, so that it is not quite straight. An ivory head
fits the upper end of the shaft, and it is tipped by an arrow-pointed
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
piece of iron, usually an old knife blade, let into a slit
in the ivory and secured by rivets. The head is about four
inches long, and is pierced near the middle for a seal-line
attached to it. This line is several yards long, and is fastened
at its outer end to a whole sealskin blown up to act as a float and
drag to the animal harpooned. The head of the harpoon is kept
in place by a loop on the line, which fits tightly over a peg on
the side of the wooden handle when the head shaft and handle
are adjusted in line. The harpoon is thrown at the seal, walrus
or whale, and its weight is sufficient to drive the head completely
through the skin; the cones between handle and shaft
then turn and disjoint allowing the line to slip off the peg on
the handle, so that the head separates from the remainder,
which floats away. The sealskin bladder is thrown overboard,
and after a few wild rushes the animal comes to the surface,
dragging it along. The native then either shoots, or kills with
the lance. The lance is somewhat similar in construction to
the harpoon, but is without the head, the ivory shaft terminating
in a wide steel blade usually cut out of a saw or large knife,
and is without barbs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other weapon of the kyak is the duck dart used to
entangle the eider ducks when they become fat and lazy in the
late summer. This instrument consists of a light wooden shaft
five or six feet long, with a trident of deer horn at its upper
end. The pieces of horn are from six to eight inches long, and
about half an inch in diameter; their sides are notched by a
number of barbs pointing downwards, and they are so set at the
head of the shaft as to project outwards at an angle of 45°,
while each piece of horn makes an angle of 120° with its neighbours.
Similar barbed prongs are attached to the shaft about
a foot from the upper end. The lower end of the shaft is flattened,
and made tapering to fit a groove in a throwing board
held in the hand of the hunter. This dart is very skilfully
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>
thrown many yards, and entangles itself about the necks or in
the wings of the ducks.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As the middle of August approaches, the natives who have
been living on the coast, and who have generally secured several
sealskins full of porpoise or seal oil for the next winter’s use,
start inland for the annual deer hunt, only leaving behind the
old people who cannot tramp long distances. These pick up a
living during the absence of the younger people by fishing and
hunting birds. The barren-ground caribou collect in great
bands in September for the mating season and for their annual
migration southward. At this time their skins are in the best
condition for clothing, and the Eskimos kill them at certain
localities where they are known to pass on their way south.
These places are often far away from the summer hunting
grounds on the coast. Going to the hunting grounds the course
of some river is generally followed, the men travelling in their
kyaks, while the women, children and dogs all carry heavy loads
overland. The early autumn is spent on the deer grounds, and
a return to the coast is not made until sufficient snow has fallen
to allow of the use of the dog sleds. The men first travel light
to the coast to fetch the sled left there the previous spring. On
their return the heavy, slow work of hauling out the meat and
skins commences, and as several loads are often necessary, with
the days very short and the snow soft, it often happens that
Christmas arrives before the coast is again reached, and the trip
for the trading post again undertaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is a short description of the life of an Eskimo living in
the northwestern part of the Labrador peninsula, and is typical
of the life of the free native in the north. Of course, the routine
varies in different localities. On the west side of Hudson
bay the Kenipitus live inland, and depend entirely upon the
caribou for food, clothing and fuel. A large number of these
natives only leave their hunting grounds for short visits to the
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>
whalers, to renew their supplies of ammunition and tobacco, or
go to the northward to hunt the musk-ox in the spring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Aivilliks of that coast confine themselves chiefly to the
seaboard. Their name signifies walrus hunters, and they go
inland in the autumn only to procure sufficient deerskins for
their winter clothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Nechilliks and Igluliks, living farther north, do not
often come in contact with the whalers, and depend largely on
their southern neighbours for ammunition and other articles of
civilization. They are in a much more primitive state, without
any modifications in their ancient customs and beliefs. The
greater number are without guns, and kill their game with the
bow and arrow or with the spear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The other natives on the shores of Fox channel rarely come
in contact with the whites, and are in a similar primitive state.
These include the Padliks and Sikosiliks, and in the same
category were the natives of Southampton island, now all dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos living about Frobisher bay and Cumberland
gulf congregate about the whaling stations, and remain there
for the greater part of the year. The whaling season in these
places is in the fall, spring and early summer, so the natives
have only the latter part of the summer in which to hunt deer
for their winter clothing. The animals are found abundantly
about the great lakes Nettilling and Amadjuak, which are
located far inland to the westward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natives of Big island and the north shore of Hudson
strait are, as before mentioned, employed on the Scotch whaling
steamer, or at the stations at Repulse bay and at Lake Harbour,
where a mica mine is worked; consequently they do not follow
their old customs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A whaling station was established in 1903, at Ponds inlet,
and the Eskimos of the northeastern part of Baffin island will
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>
soon have their habits modified by contact with the white men;
of all these northern people only those of eastern Baffin island,
together with those of the Arctic coast to the northwest of Hudson
bay, will remain practically uninfluenced by civilization or
Christianity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natives of the Labrador peninsula and those of Cumberland
gulf, under the influence of the missionaries, are gradually
giving up many of their ancient beliefs and customs. At present
these can only be studied among the tribes as yet unvisited
by the missionaries, such as those of the northwest coast of
Hudson bay, who, although long acquainted with the whalers,
have not been so influenced by them as to change their superstitions
and beliefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The writer spent the winter of 1903-04 among the Aivilliks
and Kenipitus on that coast, and paid some attention to these
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>
matters, deriving at the same time a large amount of information
from Captain George Comer, of the whaling schooner <span class='it'>Era</span>,
wintering alongside the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>. Captain Comer had already
made several voyages to Hudson bay and Cumberland gulf, on
all of which he had made ethnological collections and notes for
the American Museum of Natural History, New York. A considerable
amount of his information has been published by Dr.
Franz Boas. With the exception of the Rev. Mr. Peck, at
Cumberland, Captain Comer is probably the greatest authority
upon the manners and customs of the Eskimos.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The different tribes of Eskimos have no hereditary or elected
chiefs. Each tribe is divided into a number of small bands,
usually close blood relations. The head man of each band is
nearly always advanced in years, and holds a sort of patriarchal
sway over his sons and younger relations, altogether due to their
willingness to be guided by his advice and experience and not
to any sense of duty. At other times, when the older men are
not forceful in character, a successful younger hunter largely
influences the actions of the band. The authority of the leader
is not great, and he never asserts it by direct orders issued to
the other men; if he wants anything done he asks them if they
are willing to do it; any member is quite at liberty to refuse,
and to follow his own judgment or inclinations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The head man is usually an <span class='it'>Angekok</span>, conjuror or medicine
man, and in consequence derives some power over the band
through their superstitions. It is not quite clear if more
than one angekok belongs to each band, but they are quite
numerous, and it seems likely, therefore, that the number is not
limited to one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards the family relations among the uncivilized
Eskimos, the marriage tie is very loose, and can easily be broken
by either party. This is often done for the most trivial cause.
The Eskimos practise polygamy, and in some tribes, polyandry,
where there are fewer women than men. Many of the men
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
have but one wife, owing to their inability to support more, the
successful hunter being known by the number of his wives,
although two is the usual limit. There does not appear to be
any ceremony in connection with marriage, beyond a present to
the nearest male relative, who gives his consent to the union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Divorce is common, the chief causes being failure to produce
male children and incompatibility of temper. When a woman
is divorced she returns to her family, taking her children with
her, and both parties are free to form a new alliance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Jealousy caused by infidelity on the part of the wife is exceedingly
rare, the man taking rather a pride in the appreciation of
his wife’s charms by others. The women are jealous of one
another, and I have seen a wife take away her husband whom
she found dancing on board the ship with another woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An exchange of wives is customary, after certain feasts, or
after the angekok has performed his conjuring tricks, either to
cure sickness or to take away the effects of the breaking of some
of the many taboos. These customs make polyandry easy where
it is found necessary, as in the case of the Nechilliks, or where
only one woman accompanies a hunting party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a rule the women are treated fairly by their husbands, and
it is only in the case of a shrew, or of constant neglect of attention
to the cooking and other household duties, that corporal
punishment is resorted to; but when administered, it is severe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The missionaries are exerting their influence to make the
Eskimos monogamous; this is probably a mistake. In a greater
number of the bands there are more women than men. Under
their old customs, a man had as many wives as he could support,
and all of them were nearly on an equality. Under the new
practice he has but one wife, and the other women whom he
supports have no standing in the household, being domestic
drudges and concubines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos display a great deal of affection for their
children, especially if they are boys. Corporal punishment is
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>
rarely, or never, inflicted, and does not appear to be required.
In the case of orphans, or where a man is childless, adoption
often takes place, a child sometimes being bought from its
parents. Adopted children are rarely treated harshly. Instances
of the destruction of female children are known, but
they are rare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The aged are respected, and as a rule well looked after. In
cases of starvation, the aged sometimes voluntary elect to be left
to starve, or die of cold; in rare cases of this kind, old people, or
cripples, have been known to be abandoned, but it has generally
been a choice between being embarrassed by these weaklings
and all perishing, or of leaving them on the chance of the remainder
of the party surviving.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cases of murder and cannibalism during periods of starvation
have been authenticated among the natives of the west
shore of Hudson bay, and have been reported among other
tribes, but are resorted to only in extreme cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Murder from private reasons is very rare, and entails a blood
feud unless a settlement can be made by presents to the nearest
relatives of the murdered man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If an individual becomes dangerously obnoxious, or insane,
a consultation of the men of the band is held, and one or more
of them are deputed to remove the criminal or lunatic; in such
a case the individuals acting are held blameless in the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Supposed incurables commit suicide, which is not looked
upon as a crime, as suicides are supposed to go, after death, to
an upper heaven along with other good people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When a death occurs, the body is sewn up and kept for some
time in the iglo, after which it is drawn to a convenient spot on
the land, and there covered with boulders as a protection against
dogs, wolves and foxes. The body is removed from the snowhouse
through a hole cut in the side, and not through the door.
The reason for keeping the body a few days is due to the belief
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
that the spirit hovers about it during that time before departing,
and might be displeased if it were buried immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There appears to be a great deal of doubt in regard to the
action of the soul after death, and at times one is led to think
that the Eskimos believe in a dual soul, one of which leaves the
body and its surroundings shortly after death, the other remaining
in its environment and gradually departing for longer and
longer periods as the body decays.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of customs are observed after death among the
Aivilliks and Kenipitus. No work or hunting is permitted for
five days, and the women confine themselves closely to the house.
During this period the snow must not be scraped from the ice
window, the bed must not be shaken, nor the willow mats disturbed;
the drippings from the lamp must remain, and snow
for melting must not be cut. The women are forbidden to wash
faces, comb hair or dry boots. The men must not work on iron,
wood, stone or ivory. Some of these regulations extend beyond
the period of five days. The belongings of the dead are not
used by the others, and, if they cannot be traded to the whites,
are abandoned. When a man dies, his gun and hunting implements
are laid beside his grave, and allowed to remain there for
a certain time, until his spirit is supposed to have no further
use for them, having ceased to remain with the body, or until
the spirit is supposed to have forgotten about them. In the case
of a woman, articles of a personal nature of use to the spirit
are put alongside her grave. For some time after death visits
are made to the grave, and one-sided ‘conversations’ are held
with the spirit there to show respect and to keep it from becoming
lonely; at the same time small presents of tobacco or other
articles are left at the grave.</p>

<h2>SUPERSTITIONS AND BELIEFS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It is an exceedingly difficult task to arrive at any sure idea
of the beliefs of the Eskimo. In the first place, they are themselves
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>
somewhat hazy as to what they do believe concerning the
soul and a future state; secondly, an intimate knowledge of the
language is needed to catch their ideas on these subjects, and
thirdly, one must be very intimate with them and have acquired
their respect before they will, from fear of ridicule, discuss
such subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They all appear to have a belief in a supreme goddess,
called Nuliayok on the western side of Hudson bay, and Sedna
by the eastern Eskimos. The folk-lore in connection with these
two goddesses points to the same origin for both, and is almost
identical. The tradition is that Nuliayok was a coy Eskimo
maiden who would not marry any of the young men. She was
wooed by the fulmar, a gull, who spoke in a pleasing manner
of the life she would lead with him. He so worked upon the
senses and feelings of the maiden that she consented to accompany
him to his island home as his wife. On arriving there
she found that she had been cruelly deceived, and that the
splendid house was nothing but a nest of sticks perched upon
the high bare rocks, without any shelter from the snows or
winds. The abundant food promised turned out to be nothing
but rotten fish, and to add to her other discomforts she was
jostled by the other fulmars, so that she often had difficulty in
preserving her place on the rock. There was plenty of time for
regret before she managed to send word to her father, requesting
him to come to her rescue, which he did. Her father’s
name was Anautelik, and he took her away in his boat during
the absence of the fulmar. When the latter discovered his loss,
he caused a great storm, and Anautelik, to preserve his own life,
threw his daughter overboard, but she clung to the side of the
boat, and he cut off her fingers, one by one, to make her release
her hold. As her fingers dropped into the sea they changed into
the whale, walrus, big seal and the small seal, so originating the
sea animals. Her father next knocked one of her eyes out, after
which she let go of the side of the boat and went to the world
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>
beneath the sea, where she became queen, living in a house built
of stone and whalebone, and guarded by her husband, the dog.
She cannot walk, but ‘hunches’ over the ground with one foot
beneath her body. Her father was also drowned later, and now
lives with her, wrapped up in his tent cover, and is employed
torturing the souls of the wicked. The souls of sea animals go
to her after remaining three days by the body after death. This
is the reason a great deal of respect is shown to the bodies of
these animals, and is the origin of a number of taboos in connection
with them. If the soul is displeased on its departure for
the abode of Nuliayok it informs her, and causes her hands to
swell; then she revenges herself by bringing ill-luck or sickness
upon the Eskimos. If all the ceremonies are properly observed
they please the soul of the animal, and other animals will allow
themselves to be killed by such considerate people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It thus appears that the Eskimos existed before their goddess,
there being no legend regarding the first Eskimo. The Eskimo
story differs in regard to the origin of the white race and the
Indians, who are the offspring of Nuliayok and her dog. One
story runs that Nuliayok was deceived by the dog, who took the
form of a young man. When her father found her with a litter
of white and red pups he was very angry, and placed her with
her strange progeny upon an island, sending food to her by the
dog. Later he drowned the dog, and brought her food in his
kyak. Nuliayok, to revenge the death of the dog, set the pups on
her father, and so killed him. Being now without any source of
food for herself or the pups, she made two large slippers; into
one she put the white pups and into the other the red, and set
them afloat before a north wind, so that they landed on southern
lands and became the ancestors of the whites and the Indians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a goddess of the land-animals called Pukimma, who
appears to be closely identified with Nuliayok, and may be the
same personage under a different name.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/168a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_168' style='width:80%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Aivillik Woman in Gala Dress.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos have in addition to a number of legends concerning
the creation of the animals many other folk-lore tales,
all of a lewd character, and often without point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ideas concerning the future state of the soul are confused
and often contradictory. There appear to be three degrees of
heaven, all situated above the earth. The conditions are
heavenly according to the Eskimo view, which pictures such
places as being bright and warm, with plenty to eat and wear,
and little to do. It is probable that the idea of eternity is
beyond the comprehension of the Eskimos. They believe that
the soul of the departed will enter the body of a child named
after it, and remain for a year, with later continued influence
upon the child’s character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As before mentioned, the souls of suicides go to the upper
spirit world along with those who have observed all the taboos.
The transgressor of the taboos, and men lost by being carried
away on the ice, go to the nether world, where they are tormented
for a time by the father of Nuliayok.</p>

<h2>TABOOS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The uncivilized native has a great many strict rules to
observe in regard to the modes employed in killing animals, and
the manner and time of eating certain flesh. There are also
rules regarding work on different materials. If these rules are
not closely observed the souls of the animals become displeased,
and report the transgression to Nuliayok, who shows her displeasure
by bringing sickness, ill-luck in hunting, or some other
calamity upon the band in this life, and punishes the individual
in the next. When the taboos have been broken they can only
be condoned by open confession, in the presence of an angekok,
who, through his familiar spirit, reports the confession to
Nuliayok, and the sin is forgiven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following are a few of the many rules which must be
observed: The most heinous crime is the concealment by a
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>
woman of a miscarriage, and is the source of the greatest
calamities. A woman so unfortunate must confess immediately
to the angekok, but as the confession practically ostracizes her
for several months, the temptation to conceal her mishap is
great. A pregnant woman is debarred from eating several kinds
of meat. After childbirth she is unclean for two or three
months, and for the first month cannot visit any house in the
community. A similar rule applies to women during their
menses. A woman who has recently lost a relative must not
work on deerskins, pluck ducks, take the hair off sealskins nor
mention the names of the animals. When the men are away
hunting on the ice the women must not disturb the bedding, as
it will make cracks in the ice, and seal-line used in hunting
must be cut diagonally for the same reason. When the sun first
returns in the spring the children blow out the lamp in the
snow-house. During the time that the sun is travelling south
cat’s-cradle is played by the women and children to entangle
the sun in the meshes and prevent it being lost by continuing
south; the cup-and-ball game is played to hasten its return.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the many taboos relating to the killing of animals the
following may be mentioned: The bear is under the protection
of two goddesses, Angeakatille and Ouhowjawtil, who live in
an iceberg. No work must be done for three days after a bear
is killed, and the women must not comb their hair, nor disturb
the bedding. No cannibal may eat bear flesh, lest it should
create a taste for human flesh. The newly-killed seal has its
eyes punctured, so that its spirit may not see that it is being
taken to the snow-house. When the carcass is brought into the
house fresh snow is dipped into the kettle and the water from
it is dripped over the seal’s mouth. Before going sealing, for the
first time on the ice, a fire of shrubs is made, and the clothing
and implements of the hunter are thoroughly smoked in it. The
key block of the snow-house is at the same time scored in all
directions with the knife, to ensure good luck in hunting and to
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>
keep away disease; a white piece of deerskin and thread are
put on the ice for the same purposes. Seal bones must not be
given to the dogs. The souls of the sea animals abhor dead
bodies and blood, which must therefore be avoided by hunters.
This rule applies especially to women during their periods.
Everybody in the encampment may eat freely of the seals killed
by the successful hunter, but none of the meat must be removed
from his house.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/170a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_170' style='width:90%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Nechillik Woman.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>During the deer hunt no work must be done with sealskin.
The winter clothes and tents must be buried, while no seal or
walrus line may be taken inland. When hunting deer from
the kyak on the inland lakes a small piece of sealskin is deposited
under a stone on the margin of the lake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the musk-ox hunt is in progress, the hair must not be
removed from deerskins, and no work with iron may be undertaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All deerskin garments must be made on the land, and not
after the family has moved upon the ice, until the March
moon, when the women are allowed to work at deerskins in an
iglo on the land, but not on a day when a walrus has been
killed. Soapstone is another material which must not be worked
on the ice. No work may be undertaken on sealskins killed
during the winter, until the seals have pupped. The tusks of
freshly killed walrus must not be removed from the skull until
the winter, but work may be done during the season on tusks
taken before the new ice forms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When on the ice, deer meat must be taken into the house
through a hole in the side and not by the door, until after the
March moon, when both deerskins and meat may be taken
through the door. Deer must not be eaten on the same day with
seal or walrus, except in the walrus season, when it may be
eaten with the latter. Clothing must be changed before eating
seal in the walrus season.
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The first salmon must be caught before work on bootlegs
begins, and boots worn while hunting walrus must not be used
when salmon fishing. Salmon is always cooked over shrub fires
outside the tent, and in vessels used only for that purpose; consequently
fish taken in the winter are eaten raw.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amulets in the shape of small pieces of skin or cloth are sewn
to the under coat by the wife of an angekok to ward off sickness
and to bring good luck. Many of these are decorated with
beads. The tip of the deer’s tail is sewn to the tail of the coat
for success in hunting, and when sewn to the coat of a boy
ensures his becoming a successful hunter. A gull’s feather
dipped in the drippings of the lamp is placed between the harpoon
and spear line, and so carried to the ice, where the hunter
sucks the feather and spits in the water in order that the walrus
may not know that it is being hunted. The dried skin of a
newly-born lemming, when attached to the float of a walrus
harpoon, prevents the animal from attacking the boat when
wounded, and the skin of a lemming carried in the boat ensures
safety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are numerous other charms used, together with invocations
and songs for success in hunting.</p>

<h2>ANGEKOK.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The angekok, or medicine man, is believed by the other
Eskimos to possess supernatural powers, whereby he can charm
away sickness, lighten the displeasure of Nuliayok when she
sends famine and misfortune to the band, put the evil-eye or
something similar on those who displease him, and see into the
future. He is supposed to do this by the aid of a familiar spirit
called his tonwak, which usually assumes the form of some
animal—often that of a walrus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To become an angekok it is necessary to receive instructions
in the mysteries from some other angekok, and usually more
than one take part in the instruction and initiation of the candidate.
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
After being instructed, the novice has a series of
incantations performed over him by the assembled angekoks,
who dance round him, uttering charms. He is then taken to his
home and left for several days in solitude, during which time
he meditates and prays for his tonwak to appear; this usually
happens after several days, when all that remains to make him
a full-fledged angekok is to learn words used by them and unknown
to the uninitiated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The angekok prepares for a séance, either behind a blanket
in the tent or in the porch of the snow-house. Some of them
appear to be able to work themselves into a sort of mesmeric
trance, when they pretend to be able to transport their spirits
to distant scenes and tell what is happening there. They also
undertake to foretell the results of future hunts, and whether
success or failure will follow certain undertakings. In sickness
the angekok works all his cures by charms, the Eskimos being
entirely without medicines. He ascribes all sickness to the
breaking of certain taboos, either by the sick person or by some
close relative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They perform a number of simple conjuring tricks for the
benefit of their audience. I was present at a séance at Cape
Fullerton, where two angekoks officiated. They made their
preparations in the porch out of sight of the audience, who were
arranged in rows on the bed, and who all kept crying ‘atte atte,’
inviting the angekok to enter. Each woman wore a small piece
of deerskin on the top of her head. A long conversation was
held with the angekok outside, before he finally entered. He
first essayed to describe the place whence I came, and in this
he was not very successful. He then told us the locality of the
Eskimos who had taken our mail south some weeks before; this
ended the first part of the performance. The next time, he
entered in the form of his familiar spirit, the walrus, and to
simulate it had a pair of small tusks fastened into his mouth.
Being angry, he tried to strike the natives with the tusks, and
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>
was only prevented by considerable force. He was finally
ejected, and pursued by the other angekok, who could be heard
chasing the walrus several times over the iglo. A violent
struggle ensued. The pursuer returned to the iglo a few
minutes later with his hands and arms covered with blood,
claimed to be that of the walrus spirit. The other came in, a
few minutes later, quite unconcerned about the amount of blood
he was supposed to have lost. The second angekok now
attempted the same trick, but during the scuffle inside the iglo
caught one of his tusks in a coat, which pulled it from his
mouth. He immediately retired, and felt very bad about the
mishap. Later he came to me and asked to be excused from
working the next day, which he must spend alone appeasing his
tonwak, while all his household had to fast for twenty-four
hours. The final act was performed by the successful angekok,
who said that he would attempt to make some angekok tobacco.
While he was making his preparations a number of fresh blocks
of snow were brought in, and a depression hollowed out in each
for cuspidors, as no person must spit on the floor after smoking
angekok tobacco. He explained that angekok tobacco tasted
differently from ordinary tobacco, and that if we found this
peculiar taste, of course the thing was proved. He then clumsily
palmed a small piece of black tobacco between his hands, and
shredded it fine, after which it was placed in a new clay pipe,
lighted, and passed round the assembly.</p>

<h2>AMUSEMENTS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimos are firm believers in the old adage that all work
and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and all join heartily in
outdoor and indoor sports. Football is the popular outdoor
amusement, and men, women and children join in kicking
about the ice a ball of feathers or deer hair covered with deerskin.
There do not appear to be any rules, each playing for
himself. There is another ball game, where the ball is batted
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
with the open hand backwards and forwards, the object being
to prevent it from touching the ground. Wrestling is indulged
in by the young men; in this no tripping is allowed, and a
throw must be made from a shoulder hold. Boxing as we understand
it is not practised, but they have hitting contests, where
one man stands unguarded and allows another to hit him as
powerful a blow as he is capable of, on the understanding that
the blow may be returned under similar conditions. When
such a contest takes place between strangers it often leads to
the vanquished one, if at home, revenging himself upon the
stranger with his knife, and altogether this is a rather dangerous
pastime for grown men, although good for boys. The
children play out-of-doors during the daylight, having usually
miniature sleds to which they attach themselves, or the pups.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the indoor amusements are a number of games of
skill. A very popular game is played by suspending a small
ring of ivory by a string to the roof; another string, steadied by
a weight, hangs below the ring, often in a vessel of water to
prevent it swinging too violently. The string is twisted so that
the ring revolves rapidly, and all stand round and attempt to
pierce it with small wooded lances. A prize is given to the first
successful one, who in turn donates a prize to the second, and
so on. Another game is a variety of the cup-and-ball game. A
piece of ivory, roughly carved to represent a bear or some other
animal, is pierced full of holes and is attached by a short string
to a small ivory pencil. The play consists in tossing the large
piece into the air and piercing it with the stylus, different
values being assigned to the different holes. Cat’s-cradle is the
constant amusement of the women and children, and they have
a great number of figures unknown to the ordinary player in
civilization. The Eskimos do not appear to have the gambling
spirit strongly developed, and have few games of chance. One
of these consists in guessing the number of articles held in the
closed hand; another is played with small slabs of ivory, resembling
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
dominoes, but having a greater number of spots on
them; the slabs are thrown in the air, and the number of spots
are counted on the slabs that fall right side up. A circular disc
of ivory, usually with sawn edges, is threaded on a loop of sinew
and made to revolve in the same manner as our own small boy
spins a large button.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girls have dolls made of wood, and cleverly clothed to
represent their elders. The carving of walrus ivory passes
many an hour of the long winter. As a rule the carvings are
rude representations of various animals and other animate
objects, and have no high value as objects of art, but occasionally
there arises a real artist, who when encouraged will produce
wonderfully artistic models of the various animals, men, dog-sleds
and almost anything suggested to him. Others are expert
in making models of kyaks and hunting gear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A common amusement, accompanied by more or less ceremony,
is the sing-song. When such a performance takes place
all the natives of the band congregate in one of the larger
houses, sitting around on every available spot. The writer attended
one of these sing-songs given in honour of some visiting
natives at Cape Fullerton. The ceremony commenced by an
elderly native standing out in the middle of the floor space, and
beginning to hop gently about. His wife then started the song,
being accompanied in the chorus by the other women of his band.
The song is sung a line at a time, in a minor key, the air being
confined to about three notes. After each line the chorus of two
lines is sung, and is somewhat like, ‘Ai yea yae yaeyaeya yae’
repeated twice. While the song is in progress the man dances
and hops about the floor, occasionally uttering in a loud voice,
we-hew! we-hew! The song belongs to the man, and is his own
composition, and is composed in a rough metre to suit the air,
but does not rhyme, and no great attention is paid to the
rhythm. The sentiments are at times poetic. In this particular
song praise was given to the springtime, and a longing was expressed
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>
for its arrival; mention was also made of the trials of
women at childbirth, and wishes were formulated for good luck
to the hunters. The song continued upwards of an hour, after
which one of the strangers was invited to sing, and on his taking
the floor was presented by the old man with a hatchet as a mark
of courtesy. The stranger was a Kenipitu from Chesterfield
inlet, and as he was not accompanied by his wife he had himself
to sing his song, which he did in a loud voice. The Kenipitu
women of the neighbourhood loyally supported him in the
chorus. He first thanked the donor of the hatchet for his magnificent
present, of which he would make valuable use. He next
described the country from whence he came, and said that he
was acquainted with the hunting of the sea animals. He expressed
a wish to be a great and successful hunter, and deprecated
the waste of animals killed for food. By this time he was
fairly exhausted and his voice became very hoarse. He was
followed by another of the Aivillik tribe, but as there is a limit
to the amount of foul air and pungent odour that a white man
can stand, it was at this stage of the proceedings that the writer
fled.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/176a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_176' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Kenipitu Belles at Fullerton.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The songs sometimes are varied; when the singer ridicules
his neighbour (and an Eskimo’s joke is often much broader
than it is pointed), the song is liable to breed ill-feeling; on
this account the Christianized Eskimos of the east side of Hudson
bay no longer indulge in this amusement, but sing hymns
instead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the absence of the men on hunting expeditions, the
women sometimes amuse themselves by a sort of female ‘angekoking.’
This amusement is accompanied by a number of very
obscene rites, which were better left unrecorded.</p>

<h2>GARMENTS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The winter garments of the Eskimo are made from the skins
of animals, while only those who can procure European clothing
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>
wear anything but skins throughout the year. For winter clothing
deerskin is by far the best, and is always used where it can
be obtained. When this material is not available, sealskin, or
the skins of foxes, wolves, bears and dogs is used, and sometimes
the skins of birds. For the summer garments, sealskin
is the common material, while waterproof clothing is made from
the intestines of the Big seal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The clothing of both sexes consists of a coat, breeches, stockings
and boots. In the winter two suits are worn, the inner
with the hair next to the body and the outer one with the hair
exposed. The man’s coat is usually made to descend a short
distance below the hips, and is cut plain on the bottom. There
are no openings in the coat, and it is drawn on over the head.
It terminates above in a hood, provided with a drawing string,
so that in cold weather the opening may be closed tightly about
the face. The bottom is often provided with a fringe hanging
several inches below the garment, and made by cutting a band
of deerskin into narrow thongs. This fringe becomes entangled
with the hair of the lower garment, and serves as a wind-break.
The coat, or kulitang, varies somewhat in shape in the various
tribes, and the style seems at times to be due to the fancy of the
individual. On the east side of Hudson bay the coats are of a
moderate length; among the northern Eskimo of Greenland they
are quite short and barely reach the tops of the breeches when
the man is standing upright, while a wide section of the back is
exposed when he bends over. Along the west coast of Hudson
bay, among the Aivilliks and Kenipitus, the men’s coats are
long, and often have a short apron and tail like those of the
women. They are also ornamented by the insertion of white
patches of deerskin in the backs and on the sleeves. This white
skin is only worn by the women of other tribes. The inner suit
is made from light summer skins, while the outer ones are heavy
and thick, and are from the deer killed late in the autumn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The breeches are made loose, and reach from the thigh to a
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>
short distance below the knee, where they are quite open to provide
ventilation. They are secured to the body by a string in
the waistband and have no openings.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Kenipitu Woman in Winter Dress.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The winter boots are usually made of the skin from the legs
of the deer, carefully matched and sewn, and the feet are made
with the hair inside, so that a pair of low shoes may be worn
over them when travelling on the sled. Deerskin socks are worn
inside the boots; they are both long and short, and are worn
with the hair inside. A pair of deerskin mitts, worn with the
hair outside, complete the ordinary costume of a man, but
sometimes, in very cold weather, a pair of dogskin shoes are
slipped over the ordinary foot-gear when travelling on the sled,
as the Eskimo is very careful that his extremities are kept
warm and dry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A man’s summer clothing of sealskin corresponds closely to
his deerskin suit. All the garments, except the boots, are made
from skins dressed with the hair on, and the hairy side is worn
outside. The skins of the fœtid seal are commonly used for this
purpose, and it is only a very fortunate swell who has a suit
from the skins of the harbour seal. The boots are made of skins
from which the hair has been shaved off. For the tops, the skin
of the fœtid seal is used, the bottoms being made from the
thicker skin of the big seal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women’s clothing consists of garments similar to those
worn by the men, but they are cut differently. The coat, in the
body, is much looser, and the hood is larger and more
open, being prolonged into the back to form a receptacle for the
baby, who is carried naked there, the weight being supported
by two thongs sewn to the shoulders in front and which,
crossing the breast are attached under the arms. Unlike the
men’s coats, those of the women have an apron, reaching nearly
to the knee in front, and a longer tail behind. The inner coat
is often ornamented with beads or fancy strips of skin, while
the outer garment is decorated with strips and patches of white
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>
deerskin, all very neatly <span class='it'>appliqué</span>. On the east side of Hudson
bay the women wear breeches and boots very similar in cut to
those of the men, but on the west coast they are quite dissimilar.
There the breeches are very loose, and reach almost to the
ankles, where they are gathered in. Between the knee and
ankle they have a curious bag on the outer side of the leg, which
is used for their feet when seated within the snow-houses, the
footwear being removed and the feet withdrawn inside the
breeches and thrust into these bags—a very comfortable plan.
With such long and clumsy looking breeches, short shoes and
socks must be worn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The women arrange their hair in different fashions, often
attempting to follow those set by their more civilized sisters of
the trading stations. For example, the prevailing fashion on
the east side of Hudson bay is to wear the hair cut short, like
that of the wife of the officer of the Hudson’s Bay Company at
Great Whale river. About Cumberland gulf the hair is usually
put up in a knot on the back of the head, and this is sometimes
varied by small side knots over the ears. Among the Aivilliks
and Kenipitus, the prevailing fashion is two rolled braids
wound with string or ribbon, one over each ear. The hair when
dressed for native state occasions is separated into two side
locks, each of which is covered by a highly ornamented covering
sewn with beads, and worn as long cylinders hanging down over
the breasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The children’s clothing, when they wear any, is very similar
to that of the grown people, except that the girls, until they are
nearly mature, are not provided with tailed coats. Infants are
carried perfectly naked in their mother’s hoods until they are
about two years old.</p>

<h2>MORAL CHARACTERISTICS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The Eskimo as a rule is strictly honest, and the occasional
thief is looked down upon by the wild native as well as by the
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
partly civilized one. Not quite as truthful as they are honest,
they still compare favourably in that respect with the white
men. When the source of a lie is traced it is found to be due
to a mistaken politeness, the native intending to please by
answering in a manner which he thinks will be agreeable to the
questioner. Another cause is due to the etiquette of the people,
whereby a man always belittles his success in hunting or other
actions. When these reasons are unknown to the casual stranger
among these people he classes them as liars, when the case is not
so, for an Eskimo seldom, or never, makes a false statement to
shield himself from the consequences of ill-doing. Of course
there are black sheep in every flock, and the Eskimos have their
share of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Judged by the standards of sexual morals of civilization, the
Eskimo is a minus quantity; but who is to say what is right in
this respect among a people situated as they are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In temperament they are phlegmatic and slow to anger, being
good-natured rather than otherwise, but like all savages, liable
to ungovernable bursts of rage when roused. As a rule they
are proud and independent, with a greater sense of gratitude
for favours received than their Indian neighbours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They are not cleanly in their habits, and this is not surprising
considering that for the greater part of the year they must
melt all the water they use. The length of time required for
the decay of animal matter in the cool northern regions renders
personal or culinary cleanliness a matter of sentiment and not
of health, and they do not pay great attention to sentiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Being accustomed from childhood to the strong odours of seal
blubber and rancid meat, they are not at all delicate in their
senses of taste and smell, and it occasionally happens that their
liking for tainted meat ends disastrously, especially when a
rotten porpoise furnishes the food. The writer knows of several
deaths due to poisoning from this cause.
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As a people, they are very hospitable and kind; but like other
savages would probably soon tire of continuous efforts to support
helpless whites cast upon them, especially when the guests
assume a superiority over their hosts.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VIII.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>GEOLOGY.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The following summary of the geology of the northeastern
coast of America and of the Arctic islands is based, so far
as the southern and eastern portions of that region are concerned,
upon the observations made on the cruise of the
<span class='it'>Neptune</span>, and is supplemented by the reports of previous explorers
in the areas beyond the limit of the voyage of that vessel.
The geological work of the Arctic explorers until recent years
was necessarily poor and disconnected owing to the absence of
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>
trained men, and to such work being of secondary importance
among the objects of the expeditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The observations of these earlier explorers were carefully
gathered from the different narratives, and ably summarized
by Dr. G. M. Dawson in a report on the Geology of the Northern
Portion of the Dominion of Canada, published in 1886.
This work has been largely followed in the present report, but
such corrections have been made as are justified by the knowledge
gained in explorations since the date of its publication.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The notes on the geology of the southern part of Baffin island
are from the observations of Dr. R. Bell, while those on Ellesmere
island and the Sverdrup islands are based on the work of
P. Schei, the geologist of the <span class='it'>Fram</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rocks of the Arctic islands and of the northern coasts of
the continent present an almost continuous ascending series
from the Archæan to the Tertiary, while the upper loose material
represents various phases of the Glacial age and of the
subsequent Post-Glacial deposits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only isolated attempts have been made to subdivide the
Archæan complex into Laurentian, Huronian and other members
of the system. This lack of subdivision is due to want of
detailed knowledge; not to the absence of the various members
of the complex in these northern regions, where the greater
number of the members are known to occur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Palæozoic rocks are well represented on the islands by
thick deposits extending upwards in a continuous series from
the Cambro-Silurian to the upper beds of the Carboniferous.
Rocks older than the Galena-Trenton are only found in the
northern part of Ellesmere island, where a series of beds appears
to connect the Upper Huronian formations with the lower
members of the Cambro-Silurian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mesozoic rocks are found on the northern Parry islands, on
the Sverdrup group and on the western and northern sides of
Ellesmere island.
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Tertiary formations occur on the northwestern islands, on
the northern part of Ellesmere, as well as on the northern and
eastern parts of Baffin island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The former presence of a continental ice-cap is attested along
the northwestern shores of Hudson bay and in the southern part
of Baffin island, by the rounded and polished rock surfaces,
which are everywhere well marked by the ice striae, often in
several sets showing changes in the direction of the ice movement.
On the east side of Baffin the rock surfaces show signs of
rounding and smoothing by ice, but the striae are not well
marked, and the glaciation does not appear to have been nearly
so intense as to the south and westward. Passing northward up
the western side of Davis strait and Baffin bay the evidence of
intense glaciation becomes less and less, that on Ellesmere the
present condition of the local ice-covering would appear to
represent nearly as great an amount of glaciation as ever
occurred there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sequence of earth movements and physical conditions,
read from the geological formations of the northeast, are as
follows: An ancient floor of crystalline rocks, largely of igneous
origin, represents the most ancient crust of the earth. These,
associated with ancient bedded deposits and cut by dark basic
intrusions of trap and allied rocks, were at a very early period
so crushed and foliated that it is now impossible to separate
them. Upon this ancient complex was laid down a series of
bedded deposits, chiefly sandstones and dolomites, associated
with contemporaneous traps, as may be seen along both the
shores of Smith sound. Following this came a great outburst
of granite and other acidic igneous rocks which, over large
areas, inclosed, penetrated, compressed and otherwise altered
the sedimentary deposits to such an extent that it is now impossible
to separate them from the older complex upon which they
were originally deposited. Only in a few comparatively small
areas were the conditions of the granite intrusion such as to
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
allow the sedimentary deposits to preserve their original unaltered
conditions. All the above rocks are grouped in the
Archæan, and further and closer examination will probably
show that it contains all the members of the Laurentian and
Huronian found in the more southern Archæan regions of
Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Except in the northern part of Ellesmere, there is a considerable
time-break in the geological sequence in the northeast
between the Archæan rocks and the Cambro-Silurian strata
which rest unconformably upon them. Schei found at Bache
peninsula, on the eastern side of Ellesmere, a series of stratified
sedimentary rocks resting upon the northern flank of the
Archæan and containing fossils of Cambrian age. These deposits
have a thickness of nearly 1,500 feet, and are overlaid by
limestones containing Cambro-Silurian fossils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Archæan rocks at the time of deposition of the lower
beds of the Cambro-Silurian limestones appear to have extended
southward from the vicinity of Bache peninsula in a gradually
widening ridge along the western side of Baffin bay and Davis
strait. In this manner they attained a width of seventy miles
on the southern side of North Devon, and occupied the entire
southern shore of Baffin island, being separated from the great
area of Labrador by the depression of Hudson strait, which
probably existed at that early period. Islands of Archæan rocks
may also have risen above the surface of the Cambro-Silurian
sea in the present island of North Somerset and on Melville
and Boothia peninsulas, as well as on other portions of the
northern coasts of the mainland, to the west of Hudson bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The western Cambro-Silurian sea filled the present depression
of Hudson bay, and extended far to the south and westward
of its present limits, outliers of limestone containing fossils of
this age, and very similar in mineral character, being found in
the valleys of the great lakes of Manitoba. From Manitoba
these rocks have been traced southward into the United States,
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>
so that at the time of their deposition the Cambro-Silurian sea
occupied a great basin open to the Arctic ocean and extending
southward into the middle of the continent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the time of maximum encroachment of the northern
ocean, after which the land gradually rose, and the sea slowly
receded. Owing to the great lapse of time and the eroding of
the thick ice-cap in the more southern regions, it is exceedingly
difficult to now trace the boundaries of the narrowing sea during
Silurian and Devonian times. Cambro-Silurian limestones
containing fossils which refer them to the Galena-Trenton,
are widespread over the northern islands and in a wide margin
along the western and southern shores of Hudson bay.
Outliers of these rocks occur at the head of Frobisher bay in
the southwest part of Baffin island and on Akpatok island in
Ungava bay. As before stated, similar limestones are found in
the lake valleys of Manitoba, and it is quite possible that these
limestones were once continuous with those of Hudson bay, the
present break having been caused by the erosion of the glacier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The upward continuation of these limestones containing
Silurian fossils occupies a corresponding but slightly circumscribed
area. These Silurian limestones form the characteristic
abrupt cliffs of the islands on both sides of Lancaster sound,
and continuing southward occupy the larger parts of Southampton,
Coats and Mansfield islands in Hudson bay, as well as the
low lands of the western part of Baffin island. They are not
well marked, and are probably considerably thinner on the
western side of Hudson bay, but are found in the Winnipeg
basin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Devonian gradually emerges from the Silurian in the
cliffs of the islands to the north of Lancaster sound, and forms
the lower parts of the cliffs of the southern side of Ellesmere.
Devonian fossils are not found in the limestones of the islands
of Hudson bay, and only occur in a narrow belt on the low lands
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
to the west and southwest of James bay. Similar rocks form
the upper beds of the Winnipeg basin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no break in the passage from Devonian to Carboniferous
in the rocks forming the Parry islands and the southern
part of Ellesmere, where Carboniferous rocks occupy wide areas
on these northern islands, but are not found to the southward
of Lancaster sound, showing that the Palæozoic sea had retreated
that far north before the close of the Devonian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The land rose above the ocean at the close of the Carboniferous,
and with the exception of the northern parts of the
Parry islands, the Sverdrup group and the western part of
Ellesmere has not been deeply submerged since. Rocks of
Mesozoic age, belonging to the Alpine Triassic, have been found
in the last-named places, but in no other localities to the southward
within the limits of this report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considerable earth movements occurred at the close of the
Mesozoic period, causing those and older rocks to be highly
tilted and folded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another slight submergence took place in the Miocene Tertiary,
when shallow water deposits of sand, gravel and clay,
associated with beds of lignite, were laid down in the wide
valleys along the margins of several of the Arctic islands. Such
deposits are known to exist in Banks island, on the western side
of Ellesmere and along the northern and eastern sides of Baffin
island. There is little doubt that other deposits of this age will
be discovered when more systematic search has been made for
them in these northern regions. From the character of the
fossil plants found in these deposits there can be little doubt
that during the Miocene the climate of these northern islands
was much warmer than at present, and approached a tropical
condition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conditions of the land and water surfaces during the
Glacial period differed little from those at present, except that
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>
there has been a considerable uplift of the land, as proved by
the marine terraces found along the coasts. The maximum
uplift probably amounted to 700 feet along the eastern side of
Baffin island, and was perhaps slightly less on the islands
farther north, where Schei reports beaches 600 feet and upwards
above the present sea level. This being the case, a new
explanation must be found for the depression and subsequent
uplift of the land covered by ice, if the uplift be practically the
same in northern Ellesmere, where the accumulation of ice is
nearly as great to-day as at any previous time, while in the
southern part of Baffin island a great thickness of ice was
present during the Glacial period and has now completely disappeared.
Perhaps we have been taking cause for effect, and
the uplift due to some unknown cause may have been the cause
of a lessening of the ice; certainly the almost equal rise of the
land throughout the Arctic islands is an argument against the
subsidence of the northern lands being due to the burden of the
ice-cap, and the subsequent uplift due to the disappearance of
that burden.</p>

<h2>DETAILS OF THE GEOLOGY BY ISLAND GROUPS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>It is exceedingly difficult to write a readable, concise and
comprehensive account of the geology of the territory included
in this report without subdividing it in some manner. This
has been attempted by considering the different formations
under their separate headings, and dividing the territory, as has
been done in the geographical description, into groups of
islands, and considering each of the great geological divisions
separately.
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span></p>

<h2>ARCHÆAN.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Hudson Bay and Hudson Strait.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The territory comprised in this group includes the islands
of Southampton, Coats, Nottingham, Salisbury, Charles and
Resolution, along with the shores of the northwest part of
Hudson bay, and the south shore of Hudson strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The geological information concerning this group obtained
prior to the present voyage is contained in the reports of Dr.
Bell, Tyrrell and the writer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crystalline gneisses, schists and granites occupy the eastern
and northern parts of Southampton, extending northward from
Seahorse point to Frozen strait at the northern end of the
island. The rocks near the junction of the Archæan with the
Silurian at Seahorse point are largely a very quartzose, light-gray
mica-gneiss, associated with bands of rusty-weathering,
fine-grained mica-gneiss holding graphite in small flakes, the
rusty colour being due to the decomposition of small grains of
pyrite disseminated through the rock. This rusty gneiss closely
resembles that found in the vicinity of Cape Wolstenholme at
the entrance to Hudson strait, and both appear to be similar to
the sillimanite gneiss of the Grenville series of southern
Canada. Both of the above rocks are cut and twisted by masses
of a coarser granite-gneiss pink to red in colour, with pearly
feldspar and smoky quartz. All are cut by dikes of feldspathic
pegmatite containing much of the pearly feldspar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only notes relating to the Archæan area to the north of
Seahorse point are those of Parry and Back, both of whom
mention the occurrence of granites and crystalline rocks in
several places to the northward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The band of Archæan rocks which crosses the eastern part of
Coats island has never been examined closely, and our knowledge
of it is confined to observations made from the ship in
passing.
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The high rocky shores of the eastern and northern sides of
Salisbury island were closely followed by the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>, so that
the red, crystalline rocks forming its cliffs could easily be seen.
The prevailing rock was red, or pink, and only occasionally
were darker masses seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nottingham, which lies south of Salisbury in the western
part of Hudson strait, was visited by Dr. Bell in 1884 and
1885, when he examined the rocks in the neighbourhood of Port
De Boucherville, in its southeast part, and he there found along
with the common varieties of gneiss a number of patches of fine-grained
red syenite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles island is wholly formed of Archæan gneisses. The
prevailing rock in the western part is a fine-grained light-gray,
or pink mica-gneiss, associated with medium to coarse-grained
mica-hornblende granite-gneiss; the latter cutting and altering
the light-coloured gneisses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resolution island has never been visited by a geologist, and
consequently its rocks can only be described from observations
made while passing it in the ships. The rocks everywhere
appear to be crystalline Archæan, a red variety predominating.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The southern shores of Hudson strait from Douglas harbour
to the mouth of George river in the southeast part of Ungava
bay were examined by the writer in 1897, and a detailed statement
concerning them is given in the report of that year. The
remaining portions of this side of Hudson strait were examined
on the voyage of the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>, the part westward from Douglas
harbour to Cape Wolstenholme while sketching the coast-line
from the ship, and the greater part of that between Cape Chidley
and the mouth of George river by Mr. Caldwell in a boat
during the absence of the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> to the north in 1904. These
examinations connect with the work of the writer beyond Cape
Wolstenholme, and thus practically finish the examination of
the north and west sides of the Labrador peninsula.
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The rocks of the south coast of the strait westward from Cape
Chidley, as examined by Mr. Caldwell, show that large masses
of red and pink mica and mica-hornblende-granite, in a more or
less foliated condition, occupy the greater part of the coast area.
These granites are newer than the other crystalline rocks associated
with them, which they have inclosed and altered.
The older rocks are largely of basic igneous origin, and vary in
composition from anorthosites almost free from bisilicates, to
hornblendic and chloritic schists containing very little feldspar.
A series of light-coloured, high quartzose gneisses is also found,
and probably represents altered bedded rocks associated with
the basic igneous ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The basic rocks and the light-coloured gneisses are penetrated
by many large dikes of pegmatite from the granites. In
many places these dikes are very quartzose, and where they cut
the basic masses often contain pyrite and give indications of
other minerals. Associated with the lighter gneisses are large
long masses of rock, which carry in places considerable quantities
of graphite, in others an impure iron ore. The study of
these bands has not been sufficient to pronounce as to whether
they are veins or beds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ancient crystalline rocks occupy the entire coast-line from
the mouth of George river at Ungava bay to Cape Wolstenholme
at the eastern entrance to the strait. Mica-granite and, in less
quantities, mica-hornblende granite, both more or less foliated,
occur along the greater length of this coast. In many places
these granites are associated with other gneisses, which are
usually lighter in colour, finer in texture, and contain more
quartz than the eruptive granite. These lighter gneisses usually
are garnet-bearing, the crystals of that mineral being often of
large size. In a greater number of places the gneisses of these
two series are so closely mingled as to render a separation impossible;
but there are localities, notably along the west side of
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>
Ungava bay, where such a separation can be made, and the
lighter coloured gneisses are seen to be cut and foliated by the
intrusion of the coarser and garnet-free granite-gneisses. At
the mouth of Payne river and about the mouth of Hopes Advance
bay the change from unaltered clastic rocks to the light-coloured
gneisses is plainly seen in a number of places. The
unaltered series consists of impure dolomites, sandstones, cherts
and bedded iron ores similar to the series of rocks found in the
central parts of Labrador and along the east coast of Hudson
bay. This series bears a close resemblance to the iron-bearing
rocks of Lake Superior, and there is little doubt that they are
of the same age. In former reports they have been termed so-called
Cambrian, but by the new classification they represent
one or more members of the Huronian. These rocks are associated,
as elsewhere, with great outbursts of basic igneous
matter in the form of sills, dikes and irregular masses. Where
the newer granites have cut and inclosed masses of this series,
the different rocks forming it are seen to have undergone considerable
alteration. The bedding has been disturbed, so that
the strata lie at angles approaching the vertical, and have been
broken, and minutely penetrated by quartzose injections, both
along and across the bedding planes. Foliation and schistosity
have been induced, and the arrangement of the chemical constituents
has been altered so that new minerals are formed.
The impure cherty limestone is changed to hornblendic schists,
the impure sandstone and quartzite to garnet-bearing quartzose
gneisses, and the cherty iron ores to a gneissic rock consisting
of layers of quartz and specular iron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An examination of a number of the contacts between the
granites and the Huronian rocks shows an alteration, from a
slight crumpling and baking to highly tilted and contorted
crystalline schist and gneiss. The accompanying basic igneous
rocks, originally fine-grained traps or diabase, are changed in
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>
like manner to strongly foliated hornblendic and chloritic
schists, usually freely penetrated by quartz veins holding quantities
of pyrite and other minerals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In passing westward from Ungava bay the granite predominates
along the coast, and the areas of the altered bedded rocks
and their accompanying traps are much smaller, and are so intimately
intruded by the granite that it is very difficult to
separate them. The gneisses of the altered Huronian rocks can
only be guessed at, by their texture, light colour and the presence
of garnet in them. The ancient traps and greenstone
masses are more easily separated from the complex, but they are
so penetrated by the granites that it is impossible to trace them
except on a large scale detailed map, which would require many
years’ work to complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Large masses of these basic rocks occur along the coast in
several places between Cape Hopes Advance and Douglas harbour,
most noticeably about Wakeham and Fisher bays, where
quartz veins are numerous, and carry considerable quantities of
sulphides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The examination of the coast to the westward of Douglas
harbour was only such as could be made from the ship, and
lacks all the detail of the eastern portion. Red granite gneisses
appear to occupy the greater portion of the coast, with areas of
dark basic rocks at intervals. At Sugluk bay, where a closer
examination was made, a medium to coarse-grained pink to red
mica and mica-hornblende granite-gneiss was most abundant.
This granite inclosed bands of a lighter coloured quartzose-gneiss,
and also intruded large masses of dark-green altered
diabase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The granite-gneisses occupy the coast to within a few miles
of Cape Wolstenholme, when the prevailing rock is a rusty fine-grained
sillimanite-gneiss containing scales of graphite and considerable
pyrite in small grains disseminated through the rock.
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>
These dark gneisses are inclosed and penetrated by the granite-gneisses,
and probably represent portions of the ancient bedded
series.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond Cape Wolstenholme, gneisses occupy the eastern coast
of Hudson bay to within a short distance of Cape Smith, where
a high ridge of trap runs inland in a northeast direction and
has a width of several miles. Further south the gneisses again
predominate along the coast to the Portland promontory in
latitude 58° N.</p>

<h2>GEOLOGY OF THE NORTHWEST SHORES OF HUDSON BAY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The following account of the geology of the northwest shores
of Hudson bay has been compiled from observations made during
the trip of the launch from Winchester inlet to Chesterfield
inlet in September, 1903. These are supplemented by the notes
made in May, 1904, while making a track survey from Cape
Fullerton to the entrance of Chesterfield inlet. The observations
to the north of Fullerton were made by Mr. Caldwell, in April
and May, 1904, while on his surveying trip to the head of
Wager inlet; to these are added observations by the writer made
on a boat trip along the coast later in that spring, on the way
to and from Southampton island, when the rocks of the mainland
were examined as far north as Yellow bluff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rocks seen along the shore between Chesterfield and Winchester
inlets are largely a flesh-red to pink mica-hornblende
granite-gneiss, often only slightly foliated, and varying in texture
from medium to coarse-grained. These are associated with
broken bands of dark-gray or red gneisses, usually very quartzose,
and containing a considerable quantity of mica and hornblende,
the latter often partly decomposed to chlorite. These
gneisses have evidently been cut and broken by the intrusion of
the granite-gneisses. Many veins of pegmatite cut all these
rocks; it consists chiefly of red or violet feldspar with much
quartz, and in some places large crystals of black hornblende.
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The granite-gneisses are also most abundant inland, as was
seen along the lower part of Chesterfield inlet and in the
country forty miles inland from Winchester inlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The granites occupy the shores and islands between Winchester
inlet and the west side of Island bay, about half way to
Fullerton, when they give place abruptly to a series of dark
schists. These schists are largely micaceous, but there are also
frequent bands containing considerable quantities of hornblende,
and these are more basic than the more common mica-schists,
which always contain quartz in varying amounts. These
mica-schists appear to have been clastic rocks associated with
bands of trap, all having been altered and foliated by the granite
intrusion. The schists are very regular, and have a constant
strike of N. 10° W. Many of the basic bands contain varying
quantities of pyrite, but it was never seen in sufficient abundance
to constitute a mine. All the schists carry dark-red
garnets, some of which are regular in their crystallization and
of good size.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The islands about Fullerton harbour are formed partly of
granite and partly of these dark schists. On this eastern
contact of the granite with the area of schistose rocks, the latter
have been greatly disturbed by the intrusion, being squeezed,
contorted and broken by granite masses, as may be seen from
the illustration. Areas of coarser basic rocks now occur in the
rocks along the coast, usually in the form of coarse gabbro, but
often in a more altered condition as coarse hornblende-gneisses.
The granites are the prevailing rocks along the coast as far
north as the mouth of Wager inlet, and have generally a red or
pink colour. Associated with them and evidently altered by
their intrusion are patches of gray quartzose gneiss, and less
frequently areas of old basic intrusive rocks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Whale point, where the rocks were closely examined, the
oldest rock was represented by a medium to fine-grained, gray
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>
and pink, very quartzose gneiss. This had been cut by a coarse
diabase, and both had been foliated and broken by the intrusion
of the newer granite. Dikes of a newer diabase cut all the
other rocks.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/196a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_196' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Contorted Gneiss and Granite at Fullerton.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The granites prevail about Wager inlet, but there are more
and larger areas of the dark basic rocks about that great bay
than to the southward, making it a more promising field for
economic minerals, especially as these basic rocks generally
carry sulphides, and Rae reported free gold to have been found
about the head of the inlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the geological information concerning the western coast
of Hudson bay to the northward of Wager inlet is contained in
the narratives of the voyages of Parry and Dr. Rae. The explorations
of Rae ended at Repulse bay. He reported only
Laurentian rocks along the coast, with granite-gneisses predominating,
these being accompanied by considerable areas of greenstones,
showing the rocks in the northern part to be very like
those along the southern shores of Roes Welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Parry explored the west side of Fox channel from Frozen
strait to Fury and Hecla strait. The result of his observations
has been summarized by Dr. Dawson as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘The geological
specimens brought back were examined by Prof. Jameson,
and the detailed maps of the expedition include indications of
the character of the rock at so many places, as to afford the
means of tracing the geological outlines with very considerable
accuracy. Granitic and gneissic rocks occupy the whole of the
southern part of the east shore of Melville peninsula, and are
continued northward behind a low track of limestone country,
forming a range of mountains in the centre of the peninsula to
Hecla and Fury strait. They also form the south shore of this
strait, and most of the islands in it, and apparently the whole
eastern shore of the adjacent south part of Cockburn “island.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The rocks referred above, in a general way, to the Archæan,
probably include areas of Huronian. Jameson mentions as
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
among the prominent varieties of rocks derived from this
region, “Granite, gneiss, mica-slate, clay-slate, chlorite-slate,
primitive-trap, serpentine, limestone and porphyry.” In association
with these the following minerals occur: “Zircon and
beryl, also precious garnet, actinolite, tremolite, diallage, coccolite,
rock crystal, calc-spar, rhomb-spar, asbestos, graphite or
black lead, specular iron ore, magnetic iron ore, chromic ore or
chromate of iron, titanic iron, common and magnetic iron
pyrites.” Some of the “transition rocks” noticed by Jameson
should probably also be classed with the Archæan, and in addition
to several of the minerals above mentioned, in these were
found tourmaline (schorl) and molybdenite.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The coast between the mouth of Chesterfield inlet and
Churchill, was examined by Tyrrell, and the following summary
of the geology is taken from his report:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘On the low flat shores of Hudson bay between Seal river and
Cape Esquimaux few rock exposures occur, but those seen consisted
of granites and gneisses of typical Laurentian aspect.
For forty miles north of Cape Esquimaux no rock in place was
seen, and thence northward to Baird bay some of the points consisted
of granite and gneiss, though the shore generally consisted
of Huronian rocks.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The largest area of Huronian rocks found in this district
extends more or less continuously for 120 miles along the west
coast of Hudson bay, from near Baker’s foreland to a point 45
miles north of Cape Esquimaux.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The rocks constituting this system may be divided into three
more or less distinct groups, viz.: The Marble island quartzites,
the greenish quartzites and graywackes, and the more or less
highly altered, and often schistose diabases and gabbros.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The Marble island quartzites are composed of hard white
quartzite, consisting of more or less rounded grains of quartz,
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
of moderately regular size, cemented together by interstitial
silica. They are very distinctly bedded in thick and thin beds,
and the surfaces of the beds are often covered with beautiful
ripple-markings. The heavier beds also often show distinct
false bedding. They are usually in a more or less inclined attitude,
but they were nowhere seen to be very much crumpled or
squeezed into minute folds. Their total thickness was not
determined.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘These quartzites were first noted by Dr. Bell from Marble
island, and although this island was not examined by the writer,
rocks of undoubtedly similar character to those described by Dr.
Bell, were seen in many places along the shore, and consequently
the name is here retained.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In one place near the <span class='it'>cache</span> on the west side of Hudson bay,
a thickness of sixty feet of this quartzite, in a nearly vertical
attitude, was seen almost in contact with the Laurentian gneiss,
there being but a narrow, drift-filled gap between the two. This
would indicate either the existence of a fault, or that here the
quartzites are the base of the Huronian, or that the gneiss represents
an eruptive rock which has risen through or into the
Huronian subsequent to the deposition of the quartzite.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dark-green eruptive rocks, chiefly diabases, often very much
squeezed and altered, are largely developed in the Huronian,
composing a considerable proportion of the rocks of this system.
On the west coast of Hudson bay these rocks are cut by many
veins of white quartz, highly charged with iron and copper-pyrite.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Associated with the massive diabases, and often indistinguishable
from them except on close examination, are many beds
of fine-grained, often schistose graywacke, or greenish quartzite,
which appear to have been caught up in, or surrounded by the
eruptive rocks.’</p>

</div>
<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span></p>

<h2>GEOLOGY OF ISLAND GROUP II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This group is comprised of the great island of Baffin, with
Bylot island lying off its northeast corner, and the many smaller
islands which lie as a fringe around both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Geological specimens from the east side of Baffin were collected
by the expedition under Ross and Parry, and were
described by Dr. McCulloch. They consisted of loose specimens
collected in two localities, and give little information. Specimens
collected by Parry on the same coast were described by
Koning as gneiss and micaceous quartz rock, also some ambiguous
granitic compound in which hornblende seems to enter as
a subordinate ingredient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. P. C. Sutherland, in 1853, describes the east coast of
Baffin island between Lancaster sound and Cumberland gulf
as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘On the opposite shore (south) of Lancaster sound,
at Cape Walter Bathurst, the crystalline rocks are again recognized,
and from this point they occupy the whole coast south
to Cumberland strait and probably considerably beyond it. To
this, however, I believe there is one exception, at Cape Durban,
on the 67th parallel, where coal has been found by whalers; and
also at Kingaite, two degrees to the southwest of Durban, where
from the appearance of the land as viewed from a distance, trap
may be said to occur on both sides of the inlet. Graphite is
found abundant and pure in several islands situated on the 65th
parallel of latitude, in Cumberland strait, and on the west side
of Davis strait.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>C. F. Hall brought home a considerable collection of rocks
and minerals picked up during his explorations about Frobisher
bay and the southeast coast of Baffin island. These were named
by Prof. B. K. Emerson, and consist of ordinary Laurentian
rocks, including granite, gneiss and schists. The minerals were
magnetite, apatite, bornite and pyrite from Frobisher and
Cyrus Field bays. Lower Silurian limestones were found in a
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>
small outlier at Silliman’s Fossil Mount near the head of Frobisher
bay. This locality was visited in 1897 by a party from
the Peary Arctic expedition of that year. In the course of a
few hours they obtained fifty-four species of fossils from this
locality, which were later named by C. Schuchert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Franz Boas describes the nucleus of the mountain masses
of Baffin island to be everywhere gneiss and granite, with Silurian
limestones about the region of the large lakes of the interior
and along the low lands of the west coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. R. Bell visited the north shores of Hudson strait in 1884
and 1885, and again in 1897, when he made a close examination
of the coast from the neighbourhood of Big island to
Chorkbak inlet near Gordon bay. Dr. Bell describes the prevailing
rocks of the southern shore of Baffin island as consisting
of well stratified hornblende and mica-gneiss, mostly gray in
colour, but sometimes reddish, interstratified with great bands
of crystalline limestones, parallel to one another and conformable
to the strike of the gneiss, which in a general way may be
said to be parallel to the coast in the above distance. The direction,
however, varies somewhat in different sections of the coast.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘The distinguishing feature in the geology of the southern
part of Baffin land is the great abundance, thickness and regularity
of the limestones associated with the gneisses. At least
ten immense beds, as shown on the accompanying map, were
recognized, and it is probable that the two others, discovered in
North bay, are distinct from any of these. There would, therefore,
appear to be twelve principal bands as far as known, to
say nothing of numerous minor ones, between Icy cape and
Chorkbak inlet. The limestones are for the most part nearly
white, coarsely crystalline, and mixed with whitish feldspar.————The
limestones usually contain scattered grains of
graphite, and among the other minerals which commonly occur
in the various bands are mica, garnet, magnetite, pyrite and
hornblende.’</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>
‘Although white is the prevailing colour of these limestones,
this, in some localities, is replaced by light-gray and occasionally
by mottled varieties.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The limestone bands have not suffered greater denudation
than the gneisses, and they form hill and dale alternately with
the latter.————Owing to the scantiness of vegetation in
Baffin land, the white colour of the limestones on the sides and
tops of the hills and ridges renders them very conspicuous in
the landscape. Seen from a hill-top at a distance of fifteen or
twenty miles, they might be taken for glaciers.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘As to the total thickness of the twelve bands of crystalline
limestone which have been mentioned as occurring in this part
of Baffin land, the available data on the subject are not sufficient
to form a correct estimate, but on adding together their probable
approximate widths it seems to be no exaggeration to place their
possible total volume, great as it may appear, at about 30,000
feet, or on an average of 2,500 feet for each of the principal
bands, taking no account at all of the smaller ones.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From his observations made along the coast to the eastward
of Big island in 1885, and from the finding of crystalline limestone
fragments by Hall in Frobisher bay, Dr. Bell concludes
that the crystalline limestones extend eastward to Resolution
island, giving a very extensive development of the Grenville
series of the Laurentian in the southern part of Baffin island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At present we know that the limestones of the typical Grenville
series are only the highly crystalline equivalents of some
of the Huronian limestones. This probably is the case in Baffin
island, where these rocks with some of the accompanying
gneisses represent a highly metamorphic phase of portions of
the Huronian, while other of the gneisses are the foliated state
of the granite masses which caused the alteration of the limestones.
This would correlate the rocks on the north side of
Hudson strait with the altered Huronian rocks of northern
Labrador, where in places similar crystalline limestones occur.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/202a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_202' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Cape Haven Harbour.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Huronian rocks of Labrador are marked by the number
of repetitions of the strata caused by thrust faults in all the
areas examined, and this repetition of measures by similar
faults may account for the number of bands of limestone found
in the southern part of Baffin island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The crystalline rocks appear to form the southwest coast of
Baffin island for some distance beyond King cape on the east
side of Fox channel, when they give place to a wide area of low
lands extending nearly to the head of Fox channel, where the
crystalline rocks again form the higher lands to the north and
east of Fury and Hecla strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the late voyage of the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> the rocks of the east side
of Baffin island were examined at Ponds inlet, on the islands
on both sides of Cumberland gulf, and at Cape Haven and
Frenchmans cove on Cyrus Field bay. In other places the ship
passed sufficiently near the shores to allow of a good idea being
formed of the rocks by the aid of powerful glasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Examinations of the rocks were made at Button point, the
southeast part of Bylot island, on the north side of the entrance
to Ponds inlet; also in the vicinity of Salmon river some thirty
miles up the inlet and on its south side, and at Erik harbour on
the same side near the mouth of the inlet. At all these places
typical Laurentian gneisses and schists were obtained. Among
the specimens brought home from these localities is a light-coloured
coarse-grained augen-gneiss consisting largely of white
and pink feldspar, with thin bands of biotite and little quartz.
Another seeming variety of this rock is a well-banded fine-grained
mica-gneiss composed of pink and white bands of feldspar
separated by thin bands of mica. Associated with these
are bands of very quartzose gneiss varying in colour from light
to dark from the varying proportions of mica present. These
gneisses are usually found containing a considerable number of
dark-red garnets; and they probably represent a metamorphic
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>
series. A fine to medium-grained rock, usually somewhat foliated,
and composed largely of dark-red feldspar with much
mica, little hornblende and quartz, cuts the foregoing gneisses,
and probably was the granite which altered them by intrusion to
their present state. The basic intrusive rocks are represented
by dark-green diabase, or its alteration products, dark hornblendic
and chloritic schists and gneisses. Taken as a whole,
this series of specimens would answer for any of the typical
Laurentian regions of northern Canada.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Cumberland gulf the rocks were examined at Kaxodluin
on the south shore, some twenty miles from Blacklead station;
also at Blacklead and at Kekerten islands. At Kaxodliun
light and dark-coloured mica schists and gneisses were found,
cut by a light-pink mica-granite-gneiss. The dark schistose
rocks were decomposed near the surface, and contained a considerable
amount of disseminated pyrite. Between this place
and Blacklead the ship followed the shore-line closely, so that
the prevailing dark, rusty gneisses were distinctly seen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The most abundant rock on Blacklead island is a coarse-grained,
pink mica-granite-gneiss, containing large feldspar
crystals. This cuts, and is foliated with, coarse, dark mica-schists,
and finer-grained lighter-coloured quartzose gneisses.
Some of the dark schists contain flakes of graphite, and this
mineral is said to be abundant in places on the islands and
shores of the gulf farther to the westward, where attempts have
been made to work some of the mica and graphite deposits, without
much success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Kekerten similar gneisses are found, along with large
masses of diabase and greenstone, somewhat decomposed near
the surface, where it weathers reddish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Frenchman cove at the head of Cyrus Field bay, the
prevailing rock is a coarse-grained, red mica-granite-gneiss,
associated with bands of coarse mica-schist.
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>At Cape Haven station near the northern entrance to the bay,
pink and gray mica-gneiss prevails, and is cut by many large
dikes of red pegmatite composed largely of perthite, with some
quartz and mica. Schists forming one of the islands of the
harbour contain many well-developed crystals of pyrite, up to an
inch cube.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The northern and eastern sides of Bylot island appear to be
wholly formed of crystalline rocks, without any of the capping
limestones found upon the other islands of Lancaster sound.</p>

<h2>ISLANDS OF GROUP III.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>This group contains the large islands of Bank, Victoria,
Prince of Wales, North Somerset and King William, all situated
south of Lancaster sound and west of Prince Regent inlet.
North Somerset alone was visited by the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>; all geological
information concerning the others being from the observations
made by the several parties engaged in the search for the
Franklin expedition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. G. M. Dawson collected this information from the narratives
of these search expeditions, and printed a concise summary
of it in his report on the northern portions of the Dominion,
from which the following notes have been taken:—</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘Archæan rocks are found only on Prince of Wales and
North Somerset islands, where a spur from the great mass of
crystalline rocks forming the northeastern mainland extends
northward through the peninsula of Boothia and forms the land
on both sides of Peel sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The granitoid rocks are again found on the west side of
North Somerset, where they form the eastern boundary of Peel
sound. Boulders of the granite are found at a considerable distance
(100 miles) to the northeastward of the rock <span class='it'>in situ</span>, as
at Port Leopold, Cape Rennell, &amp;c. The general characters of
the granitic rocks in the north and west of North Somerset are
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>
thus described by Capt. M’Clintock: “Near Cape Rennell we
passed a very remarkable rounded boulder of gneiss or granite;
it was six yards in circumference, and stood near the beach, and
some fifteen or twenty yards above it; one or two masses of
rounded gneiss, although very much smaller, had arrested our
attention at Port Leopold, as then we knew of no such formation
nearer than Cape Warrender, 130 miles to the northeast;
subsequently we found it to commence <span class='it'>in situ</span> at Cape Granite,
nearly 100 miles to the southwest of Port Leopold. The granite
of Cape Warrender differs considerably from that of North
Somerset, the former being a graphic granite, composed of gray
quartz and white feldspar, the quartz predominating, while the
latter, a North Somerset granite, is composed of gray quartz,
red feldspar and green chloritic mica, the latter in large flakes.
Both the granite and gneiss of North Somerset are remarkable
for their soapy feel.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘To the east of Cape Bunny, where the Silurian limestone
ceases, and south of which the granite commences, is a remarkable
valley called Transition valley, from the junction of
sandstone and limestone that takes place there. The sandstone
is red, and of the same general character as that which rests
upon the granitoid rocks of Cape Warrender and at Wolstenholm
sound. Owing to the mode of travelling, by sledge on
the ice, round the coast, no information was obtained of the
geology of the interior of the country, but it appears highly
probable that the granite of North Somerset, as well as that of
the other localities mentioned, is overlaid by a group of
sandstones and conglomerates, on which the Upper Silurian
limestones repose directly. A low sandy beach marks the termination
of the valley to the northward, and on this beach were
found numerous pebbles, washed from the hills of the interior,
composed of quartzose sandstone, carnelian and Silurian limestone.’</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
‘Cape Granite is the northern boundary of the granite, which
retains the same character as far as Howe harbour. It is composed
of quartz, red feldspar and dark-green chlorite, and is
accompanied with gneiss of the same composition.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The granitoid rocks extend across Peel sound into Prince
of Wales island in the form of a dark syenite, composed of
quartz, greenish-white feldspar passing into yellow, and hornblende.’</p>

</div>

<h2>ISLANDS OF GROUP IV.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Archæan rocks are found only in the eastern part of this
group, on the large islands of Ellesmere and North Devon.
They rise from beneath the newer rocks on the south side of
Hayes sound a few miles north of Cape Sabine, and then
occupy the remainder of the eastern coast of Ellesmere and that
of North Devon. This area appears to form a wedge-shaped
mass expanding southward, so that on Jones and Lancaster
sounds they extend a considerable distance to the westward,
until they become capped by limestone, and then gradually sink
below the level of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both the Laurentian and Huronian divisions of the Archæan
are represented in the area. A series of bedded rocks consisting
of several thousand feet of sandstones, limestones and other
sediments occupies the coast and islands of the east side of
Smith sound, from Cape Atholl northward to Foulke fiord. On
the west side the northern limit of these rocks is Cape Isabella,
from which they occupy the shore of Ellesmere for upwards of
twenty miles to the south, the southern limit not having yet
been determined on that side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These bedded rocks are associated with dark coloured traps
and diabase, which are present in the form of sills between the
bedding; as dikes cutting the bedded rocks and as large intrusive
masses. Dr. Sutherland classified these rocks as the
equivalents of the Tertiary sandstones of Disko on account of
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
their lithological resemblance and from the occurrence of traps
with both. The southern junction of these bedded rocks with
the granites and gneisses forming the Greenland coast to the
southward was not seen, but at Foulke fiord and at Cape Isabella
the northern contact is quite plain. In both places the bedded
series, for some considerable distance from the contact, has been
tilted and fractured, while near the contact the sandstones and
limestones appear to have been changed into quartzite and
crystalline limestones by the injection of great masses of
granite. This granite seen at Cape Sabine and Cape Herschel
is an ordinary Laurentian granite, and in no way resembles the
acidic rocks of Tertiary or Post-Tertiary age, which they should
do if the bedded series were of the age assigned to them by Dr.
Sutherland. The sandstones, limestones and their associated
traps bear a close resemblance to portions of the Huronian
series found on Hudson bay and in the interior of Labrador.
There is also a similarity between their contacts with the Laurentian
granite and some of the contacts found in those more
southern localities. No fossils have as yet been found in these
rocks, and until such are found it is thought best to remove this
series from the Tertiary and place it in the Huronian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the past voyage the coast of Ellesmere island was lost
sight of about twenty miles south of Cape Isabella, and no land
was again seen on the west side of Baffin bay until Philpots
island, lying off the east end of North Devon, was reached, where
the ship passed sufficiently close to the small outlying islands to
show that they were composed of Laurentian gneisses and
granites. From thence similar rocks were seen forming the
southern shores of North Devon as far as the west side of
Croker bay, where they begin to sink slowly to the westward,
and are capped by a considerable thickness of flat-bedded
limestone, which rests unconformably upon the rounded surface
of the older rocks. The Laurentian rocks finally dip below the
sea a few miles to the westward of Cuming creek.
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The specimens from the Laurentian area, which extends
southward from Hayes sound to Cape Isabella, were collected
at Capes Sabine and Herschel. The specimens from both localities
are very similar, the prevailing rock being a moderately
coarse-grained granite, of a dark-red colour, composed largely
of red feldspar and bluish quartz, with a small quantity of biotite
in diminutive scales. These rocks are only slightly
foliated in a few places.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The specimens from the Laurentian measures beneath the
Silurian limestones at Cuming creek show a greater variety. A
red gneiss, varying in texture from fine to coarse, predominates.
It is composed largely of feldspar, with quartz and considerable
biotite. It cuts a lighter-coloured, more quartzose gneiss, and
also bands of dark mica-diorite-gneiss.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Islands of Group I.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>Flat-lying beds of light-coloured yellow and drab limestone
occupy the lowlands of the southern and western parts of Southampton
island, and also form outliers in depressions in the
crystalline rocks on the north side of the island, notably at
Duke of York bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A considerable collection of fossils was brought home from
the beds forming the southern half of the west coast of the
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>
island. These have been examined by Dr. Ami and Mr. Lambe,
whose determinations will be found in Appendix iv. The
fossils show that the rocks contain a fauna closely resembling
that of the Lake Winnipeg basin, and extend over a period from
the Galena-Trenton to the Guelph and Niagara, or from the
upper part of the Cambro-Silurian to high up in the Silurian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Soundings taken on the even bottom of Fisher strait show
that the limestones extend without a break to Coats island (to
the southward of Southampton), where they occupy all of its
surface except the portion at the east end of the island where
the Archæan ridge crosses it. A few fossils from Mansfield
island show that it also is formed of limestones of these
horizons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Cape Chidley a collection of fossils from loose pieces of
limestone corresponds with fossils from Akpatok island, and the
direction of ice movement out of Hudson strait leaves little
doubt that the loose limestone of Chidley came from that island.
These fossils show a slightly wider range in age than the rocks
of Southampton do; they extend from the Lower Galena-Trenton
to the Lower Heidelberg.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>West Coast of Hudson Bay.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The wide fringe of limestones which is found along the west
shores of Hudson bay to the southward of Churchill do not come
within the limits of this report. To the northward only
Archæan rocks are found along the mainland until the northern
half of Melville peninsula is reached, where Parry describes a
wide area of sandstone, probably the base of the Cambro-Silurian,
as separating the highlands of the interior from the
western shores of the northern part of Fox channel. These
rocks are continued on the north side of Fury and Hecla strait,
where they are found on the west side of Baffin island fronting
on Prince Regent inlet.
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span></p>

<h3><span class='it'>Islands of Group II.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The only known occurrence of Silurian limestone on the
eastern side of Baffin island is at Silliman’s Fossil Mount, near
the head of Frobisher bay, where the limestone forms a hill
1,000 yards long and 350 feet high, resting almost flat upon
the crystalline rocks. Seventy-two species were identified by
Schuchert from fossils brought back from this locality; he
refers them all to the Galena-Trenton.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little is known of the limestone about the great lakes,
Nettilling and Amadjuak, in the interior of Baffin, beyond the
meagre observations of Boas, who briefly refers to the limestone
about Nettilling and along the east side of Fox channel. These
limestones are probably an eastern extension of the Southampton
area, but their exact age will remain unknown until fossils
have been collected from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the east side of Prince Regent inlet the rocks composing
the high cliffs of Baffin island are the basal sandstone and shale
overlaid by limestones, which in places are interbedded with
beds of gypsum. These high cliffs of limestone extend eastward
along the south shore of Lancaster sound to the mouth of
Admiralty inlet, when they give place to the Archæan crystalline
rocks, which rise slowly to the eastward from beneath the
level of the sea, in a manner similar to that already described,
on the north side of Lancaster sound.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Islands of Group III.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The large islands of this group are mainly built of Silurian
limestones. North Somerset was the only island of this group
visited in the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>, and all information concerning the
others is derived from the observations made on earlier expeditions,
and contained in Dawson’s summary of the northern
geology.
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Silurian limestones form the southern third of Banks
island, being overlaid in the northern part by beds of Devonian
and lower Carboniferous age. Dr. Rae reports the entire southern
coast of Victoria island as being composed entirely of
Silurian limestone.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘The northern part of King William land, with Matty island
to the east of it, are described by Sir John Ross as of limestone.
Simpson states the eastern part of the south shore to be also of
limestone, and Haughton dealing principally with the results
of M’Clintock’s voyage writes as follows: “The east side of
King William island, though composed of Silurian limestone
like the rest of the island, is strewed with blocks of black and
red micaceous gneiss, like that of Montreal island, and black
metamorphic clay-slate, in which the crystals of mica are just
commencing to be developed. It is probable that the granitoid
rocks appear at the surface somewhere to the eastward of this
locality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Numerous excellent though brief notes on the geology of the
eastern and southwestern coasts of the Boothian peninsula occur
in Sir John Ross’ remarkable narrative referred to. From these
we learn that the eastern shore is composed of limestone to Port
Logan (latitude 71° 21´), where a high range of hills—which
is seen at a distance estimated at thirty miles inland at Creswell
bay (further north) and runs north-and-south—impinged on
the shore, and was found to consist of granitoid and gneissic
rocks. Thence southward, from notes given in the body of the
narrative, a narrow border of limestone may skirt the shore to
about latitude 70° 35´, though the geological appendix does not
make any mention of this.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The narrow neck of the Boothian peninsula, which was
crossed by Ross on several lines, is, from his description, composed
of granitic rocks, with some outliers of limestone. One
of these, definitely mentioned in the narrative but not in the
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>
geological appendix, is shown on the present map. On the coast
of the mainland, west of the isthmus, the limestone formation
is found resting on the granites of Lake Wittersted. Northwest
from the isthmus the southwest coast of Boothia presents a
range of granitoid hills, running northward, but becomes
fringed by a low border of limestone near Cape Isabella, and
this increases in width to the north, till an extensive flat limestone
region is found in the vicinity of the magnetic pole.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At Bellot strait a junction occurs between the granite and
horizontal beds of Silurian limestone.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘The entire western portion of Prince of Wales island is
composed of Silurian limestone, which in the extreme west, at
Cape Acworth, becomes chalky in character and non-fossiliferous,
resembling the peculiar Silurian limestone found on the
west side of Boothia Felix.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The northern and eastern shores of North Somerset are of
limestone, usually rising from the water in precipitous cliffs.
These were examined at Port Leopold, where the cliffs rise sheer
1,000 feet from the sea. The bedding of the limestone is very
distinct, and the face of the cliff has been sculptured by every
runlet, so that between the horizontal and vertical markings the
cliffs resemble on a gigantic scale the fluted walls of a castle.
Fossils were collected from the lower beds of the cliff by
M’Clintock, but none were collected on the present voyage.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Islands of Group IV.</span></h3>

<p class='pindent'>The discovery of the Silurian limestone of the southern cliffs
of North Devon and Cornwallis was made by Parry, while his
collection of fossils was supplemented by those found by the
Franklin search expeditions. Our knowledge of the geology of
Ellesmere was, previous to the Sverdrup expedition, mainly due
to the work of Feilden and De Rance in connection with the
British expedition of 1875-76. Mr. P. Schei, the geologist who
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
accompanied Sverdrup, collected much valuable information
concerning the rock formations of Ellesmere. A summary of
his observations is published as an appendix to Sverdrup’s
‘New Land,’ and is freely quoted from in the following.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rocks found on the north side of the Archer plateau,
in the eastern part of Ellesmere to the north of Cape Sabine,
are very interesting geologically, as they show the only trace
of an unbroken sequence of beds from the Huronian up through
the Cambrian to the Silurian limestones so widely distributed
on the Arctic islands. These rocks are described by Schei as
follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘At Cape Camperdown, on Bache peninsula, is found
granite overlain by an arkose-like conglomerate sandstone, in
flat strata, the dip being north-northwest. Its thickness here
probably does not exceed 500 feet, though the contour swells to
considerably greater magnitude by reason of intrusions of diabase,
occasioning an additional thickness of perhaps 300 feet.
At its upper part this sandstone merges gradually, by interstratification,
into a series of gray, sandy and marl-like schists
and limestone conglomerates. From a few inches up to a couple
of yards in thickness these conglomerates and schists, continuously
interstratified, build up a series 600 to 900 feet in thickness,
interrupted by two compact beds of yellowish-gray dolomitic
limestone about 150 feet in thickness. These are again
overlain by a series similar to the underlying one, excepting
that here the limestone conglomerates exceed the schists.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In a detached block, in all probability originating from one
of the two 150-foot beds, were traces of fossils, of which one,
<span class='it'>Leptoplastus</span> sp., can be identified. In another detached block,
whose mother rock is not known, was found <span class='it'>Anomocare</span> sp. It
may be said with certainty after the finding of these fossils that
this series contains deposits of the Cambrian age.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The second series of conglomerates is overlain by a light
grayish-white limestone in a bed some 300 feet in thickness,
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>
observed in the midst of the section of Cape Victoria Head.
Indistinct Orthoceras, Lichas and Symphysurus assign this
limestone to the Lower Silurian period.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Above the othoceras-bearing, light-coloured limestone bed
are some less extensive strata of alternating limestone and
quartz-sandstone, and finally a 100-foot bed of close brown limestone
of which certain layers are fossiliferous, and gave an
<span class='it'>Asaphus</span>, traces of other Trilobites and some Gasteropods.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Following the direction of the dip to the north side of
Princess Marie bay we find it again, though seemingly somewhat
abrupter, in the limestone beds of Norman Lockyer island.
A fauna with <span class='it'>Halysites</span> sp., <span class='it'>Zaphrentis</span> sp., <span class='it'>Orthisina</span> sp.,
<span class='it'>Rhynchonella</span> sp., <span class='it'>Leperditia</span> sp., <span class='it'>Illœnus</span> sp., &amp;c., assigns this
limestone to Lower Silurian. It is again found with its fauna
at the base of Cape Harrison; in this case with a thick super-incumbent
bed of marly sandstone, quartz-sandstone, and finally
extensive limestone conglomerate. This also occurs near the
shore in Cape Prescott, indicating by its presence in the strike
of the limestone of Norman Lockyer island the disturbance
undergone by these tracts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The line along which this disturbance took place is refound
on the west side of Franklin Pierce bay, where the beds of limestone
conglomerate dipping from the heights of Cape Harrison
are cut off in the strike by a limestone, dark-gray in colour and
broken into a breccia.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In another place Schei hints that the rocks of the Cape Rawson
beds, consisting largely of dark shales and impure limestones,
found along the northern parts of the eastern shores of
Ellesmere, may be of Triassic age, in sharply folded troughs of
the older rocks, and consequently much younger than Cambrian,
to which age they were referred by Fielden and De Rance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Writing of the Silurian beds found on the southern coast of
Ellesmere, Schei describes them as answering to the northern
series, and their occurrence is as follows:—
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘There are at Havnefjord, in Jones sound, above some layers
of quartz-sandstone, which entirely cover the gneiss-granite
there, a series of limestone conglomerates with marly schists
and pure limestones of a thickness of 1,200 to 1,500 feet. These
are again overlain by a series of beds at least 2,000 feet thick,
of hard, impure limestones, brown or yellowish-gray in colour,
and often remarkably heavy.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘At South cape, which is entirely composed of this brown
limestone, are found in the lower parts <span class='it'>Maclurea</span> sp., and
<span class='it'>Halysites</span> sp., referable to the Middle Silurian, while west of it,
at Bjorneborg, the upper parts of the series contain badly preserved
remains of Orthocerata, Corals, and <span class='it'>Pentamerus</span> cfr.
<span class='it'>tenuistriatus</span>. Hereafter the upper part of the limestone seems
to be equivalent to the older Upper Silurian (Landovery). This
brown limestone occurs from South cape westward to Kobbebugten
in Hell Gate, and is broken at Lille Sandor, tectonic
disturbance bringing up the underlying conglomerate series,
and even the Archæan.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘On the south side of Rendalen appears the brown limestone
of the capes, Series A, with a flat dip to the north-northwest;
but on the north side of the valley is a division of dark schist,
Series B, lying conformably above the beds of brown limestone.
Associated with these schists, particularly in their lower and
upper parts, are numerous layers of pure dark limestone, frequently
fossiliferous. In Rendalen and in Kobbebugten, where
this same division also appears, a quantity of material was
collected, of which fifteen species are provisionally determined,
among them being <span class='it'>Favosites</span> sp., <span class='it'>Strophomena</span> cfr. <span class='it'>euglypha</span>,
<span class='it'>Meristella</span> in numbers, <span class='it'>Rhynchonella</span> cfr. <span class='it'>borealis</span>, <span class='it'>Pentamerus</span>
cfr. <span class='it'>galeatus</span>, <span class='it'>Spirifer</span> cfr. <span class='it'>elevatus</span>. The period of this division
in Series B is Wenlock.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The upper part of Series B appears, among other places, at
the headland north of Tunneldalen, in Hvalrosfjord. Above a
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>
black shale containing <span class='it'>Monograptus</span> sp. and <span class='it'>Leperditia</span> cfr.
<span class='it'>phaseolus</span> is a bed of fragmentary limestone with <span class='it'>Favosites</span>,
<span class='it'>Strophomena</span> cfr. <span class='it'>pecten</span>, <span class='it'>Atrypa reticularis</span>, <span class='it'>Pterniea</span> cfr.
<span class='it'>Sowerbyi</span>. From a locality in Gaasefjord, on the same horizon,
were taken <span class='it'>Favosites</span> cfr. <span class='it'>Hisingeri</span>, <span class='it'>Favosites Gothlandicus</span>,
<span class='it'>Thecia Swinderenana</span>, <span class='it'>Spirifer elevatus</span>, <span class='it'>Spirifer</span> cfr. <span class='it'>crispus</span>,
<span class='it'>Strophomena corrugatella</span>, <span class='it'>Dav.</span>, <span class='it'>Pterinea</span> sp. According to
these, the period of this upper part of Series B should be Ludlow.
The thickness of the series is about 1,000 feet.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In Hell Gate, as well as in Gaasefjord, these strata are overlaid
by Series C; in its lower parts consisting of interstratified
light and dark marl schists, which are somewhat sandy, while in
its upper part appear pure quartz-sandstone beds and argillaceous
sandstone. The collective thickness of these strata is about
1,000 feet in Gaasefjord, while in Hell Gate it is probably
somewhat greater. No fossils were found in this series.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘At the base of the high cliffs at Indra Eide and Borgen
appears Series C. In both of these places it is overlain by a
dark limestone and black shale, partially fossiliferous. This
dark limestone and shale are the lowest layers in a series of
strata at least 1,500 feet in thickness, Series D, which appears
in the profiles on both sides of Gaasefjord, from Borgen to the
foot of Vargtoppen (Wolf Top), and from Indre Eide to
Skrabdalen.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In Series Da occurs <span class='it'>Atrypa reticularis</span> in great quantities,
but little else. On the other hand, there are preliminary determined
in Db about fifty-five species, of which may be mentioned:
<span class='it'>Favosites</span> sp. div., <span class='it'>Columnaria</span> sp., <span class='it'>Cyathophyllum</span> sp.
cfr. <span class='it'>hexagonum</span>, <span class='it'>Recaplaculites</span> sp., <span class='it'>Fenestella</span> sp., <span class='it'>Homalonotus</span>

nautilus and ganoid scales.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The fauna in Dc is merely a repetition, and in the case of
certain species, a further development, of the forms found in
Db. It will thus be seen that there is a spring in regard to the
fauna between the upper layers in Series B and the lower ones
in Series D, which more particularly resemble Lower or Middle
Devonian. The concordantly embedded (?) Series C might,
therefore, be thought to represent uppermost Silurian as well as
lowest Devonian.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Divisions Dd and Df are poor in fossils, and are partly shale
divisions. In the impure limestone of Dg occur again numerous
fossils, among which are <span class='it'>Atrypa reticularis</span>, <span class='it'>Rhynchonella</span> cfr.
<span class='it'>cuboides</span>, <span class='it'>Spirifer</span> cfr. <span class='it'>undifera</span>, <span class='it'>Productus</span> sp., <span class='it'>Terebratula</span> cfr.

sp., <span class='it'>Proetus</span> sp. Traces of placoderm fish are also met
with. Above these strata are beds of purer limestone Dh, and
above these again some less pure, Di. The uppermost strata of
Di alternate with strata of light-gray quartz-sandstone terminating
in a clay-sandstone, which in places is richly fossiliferous,
though the fossils are in a bad state of preservation. Among
these are lamellibranchiata, <span class='it'>Dechenella</span> sp., remains of <span class='it'>Holoptychius</span>,
&amp;c.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘This argillaceous sandstone is simultaneously the last link
in Series D and the first in Series E. This is a huge collection
of quartz-sandstone strata building up the mountains on both
sides of the inner part of Gaasefjord. The lowest part, which
is 900 to 1,200 feet in thickness, consists almost exclusively of
quartz-sandstone. On the north side of Skrabdalen, in the
sandstone profile, occur conglomerate strata, half an inch to an
inch in thickness. In these were found considerable remains
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>
of <span class='it'>Coccosteus</span> sp., <span class='it'>Holoptychius</span> sp., and <span class='it'>Modolia angusta</span>. In
the same strata with these were also seen indeterminable plant-fossils.
Slightly higher up in the profile, however, in a black
shale which occurred in two lentiform masses, eighteen inches
and six feet in thickness, were found numerous plant-fossils.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Professor Nathorst, of Stockholm, who has kindly undertaken
the examination of these, says that among others are
<span class='it'>Archœopteris fissilis</span> Schmalh. and <span class='it'>Arch. archetypus</span> Schmalh.,
both characteristic of Upper Devonian. In examining the
material collected, Professor Nathorst also found with the plant
remains some remains of fishes.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From the above it will be seen that on the southern side of
Ellesmere there is a complete succession of strata, bearing fossils
from Middle Silurian age up to the Upper Devonian. These
strata have an aggregate thickness of 8,000 feet, and form the
thickest and most carefully measured section of the Silurian
and Devonian beds of the Arctics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the southern and southwestern parts of North Devon the
Silurian strata are much thinner than those described by Schei.
At Cuming creek the Archæan gneisses were found overlain
unconformably by red and purple arenaceous shales and thin
bedded sandstones having an aggregate thickness of fifty to one
hundred feet. These in turn were succeeded by beds of impure
limestone of light-gray or creamy colour. The beds are usually
under two feet in thickness, and separated by thinner beds containing
a considerable amount of clay. These light-coloured
limestones have a thickness of over 1,000 feet in the cliffs on
both sides of the creek. The sides of the cliffs are covered with
broken limestone, so that it was impossible to measure a section
up them, but in two or three places a darker coloured limestone
conglomerate was found, made up of small pebbles cemented by
a dark shaly matrix. Fossils are only found in the beds immediately
overlying the dark shales and sandstones of the base.
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>
These show that the lower limestone is of Silurian age, about
the horizon of the Niagara.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Limestone Cliffs of North Devon Island.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similar conditions prevail in the cliffs at Beechey island,
where a large collection of fossils was obtained from the lower
limestone beds, while others, picked up loose, but evidently
fallen from the cliffs above showed that the upper beds passed
close to if not into the Devonian, as stated in Appendix IV.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar Silurian limestones constitute the island of Cornwallis,
to the westward of North Devon, while in the remaining
Parry islands farther west the Silurian strata are lost beneath
the Devonian and Carboniferous rocks of those islands.</p>

<h2>DEVONIAN.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The work of the older geologists, which was summarized by
Haughton and later by Dawson, took no account of the Devonian
in their divisions of the Palæozoic rocks of the islands north
of Lancaster sound. All the lower limestones were classed as
Silurian, while the overlying sandstones were placed in the
Carboniferous. Fossils of Devonian age were collected, by the
expedition of 1876, from the northern part of Ellesmere, but
their occurrence and relations were only finally settled by Schei
as given above. From his observations it is plain that the upper
part of the limestones and the lower 1,000 feet of the overlying
sandstones are of Devonian age. The early explorers were not
trained geologists, and it could hardly be expected that they
would discover the thin bands containing fossils in these great
thicknesses of barren beds. Owing to this supposed lack of fossils
the rocks were separated into Silurian and Carboniferous
almost wholly on lithological differences, the limestones being
classed as Silurian and the sandstones as Carboniferous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no doubt that Devonian rocks are included in the
Carboniferous of the western Parry islands, but as they occur
only in the cliffs underlying the Carboniferous beds that cover
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>
the surface of the islands, it would be impossible to map them
on the scale used in illustrating this report, and in consequence
the old colouring is followed here.</p>

<h2>CARBONIFEROUS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The southern boundary of the Carboniferous sandstones with
their included coal seams crosses the southern part of Banks
island in a north-northeast direction, and they consequently
cover the northern two-thirds of that island, while the extreme
northwest portion of Victoria island is also occupied by these
rocks. The western Parry islands on the north side of Melville
sound are almost wholly formed of these rocks, whose southern
boundary strikes northeast across the northern half of Cornwallis
island. They are found again in Grinnell peninsula, the
northwest portion of North Devon, and again on the western
side of Ellesmere, in the vicinity of Store Bjornekap, being
probably largely developed in the northeast part of that great
island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These rocks are described as follows by Professor Haughton:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘The Upper Silurian limestones, already described, are succeeded
by a most remarkable series of close-grained, white
sandstone, containing numerous beds of highly bituminous coal
and but few marine fossils. In fact the only fossil shell found
in these beds, as far as I know, in any part of the Arctic Archipelago
is a species of ribbed <span class='it'>Atrypa</span>, which I believe to be
identical with the <span class='it'>Atrypa fallax</span> of the Carboniferous slate of
Ireland. These sandstone beds are succeeded by a series of blue
limestone beds containing an abundance of marine shells, commonly
found in all parts of the world where the Carboniferous
deposits are at all developed. The line of junction of these
deposits with the Silurian on which they rest is N. E. to E.
N. E. (true). Like the former, they occur in low flat beds,
sometimes rising into cliffs, but never reaching the elevation
attained by the Silurian rocks in Lancaster sound.’</p>

</div>
<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Coal, sandstone, clay-ironstone and brown hematite, were
found along a line stretching E.N.E. from Baring island,
through the south of Melville island, Byam-Martin island and
the whole of Bathurst island. Carboniferous limestones, with
characteristic fossils, were found along the north coast of
Bathurst island, and at Hillock point on Melville island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the comparison of different coal exposures noted by
M’Clintock, M’Clure, Austin and Parry in the Parry islands,
Professor Haughton has laid down the approximate outcrops of
some of the coal beds. These he finds to agree remarkably well
with the trend of the boundary of the formation drawn from
totally different data. Lists of fossils and rocks from the following
places, with notes, are given:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘Hillock point, Melville
island (latitude 76° N., longitude 111° 45´ W.). Bathurst
island, north coast, Cape Lady Franklin (latitude 76° 40´ N.,
longitude 98° 45´ W.). Princess Royal island, Prince of Wales
strait, Baring island (latitude 72° 45´ N., longitude 117° 30´
W.). In connection with this place it is noted that the Carboniferous
sandstones underlie the limestones, and that it is
probable that the coal beds of Melville island are very low down
in the series, and do not correspond in geological position with
the coal beds of Europe. Cape Hamilton, Baring island (latitude
74° 15´ N., longitude, 117° 30´ W.). Cape Dundas, Melville
island (latitude 74° 30´ N., longitude 111° 45´). Cape
Sir James Ross, Melville island (latitude 74° 45´ N., longitude
114° 30´). Cape Providence, Melville island (latitude 74° 20´
N., longitude 120° 30´ W.). Winter Harbour, Melville island
(latitude 75° 35´ N., longitude 110° 45´ W.). Bridgeport

Bathurst island (latitude 75° 30´ N., longitude 102° W.).
Bathurst island, Bedford bay (latitude 75° N., longitude 95°
50´ W.). (Vesicular scoriaceous trap rocks were found here by
M’Clintock, though no such rocks are mentioned elsewhere in
connection with the Carboniferous.) Cornwallis island,
McDougall bay. Silurian and Carboniferous fossils were found
together at the last mentioned place.'————</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Haughton also notes that</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘the sandstone of Byam-Martin
island is of two kinds—one red, finely stratified, passing
into purple slate, and very like the sandstone of Cape
Bunny, North Somerset, and some varieties of the red sandstone
and slate found between Wolstenholm sound and Whale sound,
West Greenland, latitude 77° N. The other sandstone of
Byam-Martin island is a fine, pale-greenish, or rather grayish-yellow,
and not distinguishable in hand specimens from the
sandstone of Cape Hamilton, Baring island.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Parry also
describes Byam-Martin island as essentially composed of sandstone,
with some granitic and feldspathic rocks, these last being
probably erratics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Respecting the coal seams which have been discovered in the
Arctic Archipelago, Professor Haughton further remarks:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘If
the different points where coal was found be laid down on a
map, we have, in order, proceeding from the southwest, Cape
Hamilton, Baring island; Cape Dundas, Melville island, south;
Bridgeport inlet and Skene bay, Melville island; Schomberg
point, Graham-Moore bay, Bathurst island; a line joining all
these points is the outcrop of the coal-beds of the south of Melville
island, and runs E.N.E. At all the localities above
mentioned, and indeed in every place where coal is found, it
was accompanied by the grayish-yellow and yellow sandstone,
already described, and by nodules of clay-ironstone, passing into
brown hematite, sometimes nodular and sometimes pisolitic in
structure.’</p>

</div>
<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Armstrong, of the <span class='it'>Investigator</span>, referring to the northern
part of Banks island, states that outliers of Carboniferous limestone
are found at Cape Crozier and near Mercy bay, along
with the sandstones and shales with coaly streaks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is doubtful if the Carboniferous rocks occur on the northwest
part of North Devon, though placed there by De Rance
and Dawson. Schei found only Silurian and Devonian on the
northern part of that island explored by him, and the Carboniferous
rocks do not show on the west coast of Ellesmere until
Store Bjornekap is reached. If a line were carried from the
outcrops of these rocks on Bathurst island northward to Store
Bjornekap it would cross the western part of Grinnell (island)
peninsula, but there is no reason to suppose that the outcrop
would follow such a line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Carboniferous rocks of western Ellesmere appear to be
isolated areas resting upon the underlying Devonian, and in
turn covered by Mesozoic rocks. Schei describes the area at
Store Bjornekap as consisting in its lowest part of beds of
brownish-gray, hard, fossiliferous limestone; higher up, of a
white pure limestone, flinty limestone and pure flint strata,
richly fossiliferous, among the fossils being <span class='it'>Lithostrotion</span> sp.,
<span class='it'>Fenestella</span> sp., <span class='it'>Streptorhynchus crenistria</span>, <span class='it'>Rhynchonella (Pugnax)</span>
sp., <span class='it'>Spirifer</span> cfr. <span class='it'>ovalis</span>, <span class='it'>cuspidatus</span>, <span class='it'>mosquensis</span>, <span class='it'>Productus</span>
cfr. <span class='it'>semireticulatus</span>, <span class='it'>costatus</span>, <span class='it'>punctatus</span>, <span class='it'>cora</span>, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The extreme northeast part of Axel Heiberg island is marked
as Carboniferous by Schei, but there are no notes concerning
this locality in his geolocigal summary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Carboniferous sandstones have not been found in the
northeast part of Ellesmere island, but limestones of that age
were found in several localities to the west of Dana bay, and
there is every likelihood that rocks of this age extend across the
northern part of the island to join those of the western shore
and the northern part of Axel Heiberg island.
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span></p>

<h2>MESOZOIC.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The discovery of the Sverdrup group of islands has greatly
extended our knowledge of the Mesozoic rocks of the Arctic
basin. The Franklin search parties discovered rocks of this age
on the northern shores of the Parry islands; at Point Wilkie,
in Prince Patrick island; Rendezvous Hill, near the northwestern
extreme of Bathurst island and at Exmouth island and
places in the vicinity, near the northwest part of North Devon.
The explorations from the <span class='it'>Fram</span> now show that these are but
the southern edge of a wide basin of these rocks which form the
islands of King Oscar, Ellef and Amund Ringes, while they
constitute the lowlands of Axel Heiberg and the western shores
of Ellesmere along both sides of Eureka sound. There they
consist largely of sandstones with shales, schists and limestones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As before stated, Schei hints that their eastern extension to
the shores of Kennedy channel may be marked by the tilted and
folded strata, classed by De Rance as the Cape Rawson Series,
of supposed Cambrian age.</p>

<h2>TERTIARY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Deposits containing fossil wood were discovered by M’Clintock,
M’Clure and Armstrong in the southwestern part of
Prince Patrick island and on the northwest side of Banks
island.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘At Ballast beach, on Banks land, large quantities of fossil
and sub-fossil wood occur, which Prof. Heer refers to the Miocene
in his Flora Fossilis Arctica, in which the following
species are described by Cramer: <span class='it'>Pinus MacClurii</span>, <span class='it'>Pinus
Armstrongi</span>, <span class='it'>Cupressinoxylon pulchrum</span>, <span class='it'>Cupressinoxylon polyommatum</span>,
<span class='it'>Cupressinoxylon dubium</span>, <span class='it'>Betula M’Clintockii</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In many places along the western side of Ellesmere, in the
depressions between the mountains, thick deposits of sand with
embedded strata of lignite were found. Similar deposits were
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
found in the lowlands east of Blaamanden, and at the head of
Stenkulfjord in Baumann fjord. In addition to the lignite,
masses of slaty clay were found in the latter place, in which
were well preserved remains of <span class='it'>Sequoia Langsdorfii</span>, <span class='it'>Taxodium
distichum</span> var. <span class='it'>miocenum</span> and some others, well known witnesses
to a southern vegetation in these regions in a geologically late
period, i.e., the Miocene.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The knowledge of the Tertiary deposits of the east side of
Ellesmere is summarized as follows by Dawson:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘Small outlying
areas of Tertiary (Miocene of Heer) are noted as occurring
at Water-course bay, at the entrance of Lady Franklin sound,
and in two places on the north shore of the sound. Coal is
found in these beds in association with black shales and sandstones,
and from collections made by Capt. Fielden and Dr.
Moss, Prof. Heer describes thirty species of plants closely allied
to the Spitzbergen Tertiary flora, and indicating rather colder
conditions than are expressed by the character of the Disko
island Tertiary plants. The coal appears to be an excellent fuel,
containing only 2·01 per cent of water.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Capt. Greely’s expedition (1881 to 1884) though so important
in its results from a geographical point of view, has added
comparatively little to our geographical knowledge of Grinnell
land and the northern coast of Greenland, a fact due to the
absence of a geologist and the enforced abandonment of the
specimens collected. From a careful perusal of Capt. Greely’s
narrative ('Three Years of Arctic Service, 1886'), and from
information obligingly supplied by him and by Lieut. Brainard,
in answer to inquiries made by correspondence, some facts of
importance are, however, brought out. The Tertiary coal-bearing
formation is evidently much more widely spread in the part
of Grinnell land, in the vicinity of Lady Franklin sound, than
the previously quoted map of Messrs. Fielden and De Ranco
would indicate, though it may probably be regarded as forming
detached outliers (which I do not venture to outline) on the
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
Cape Rawson beds, shown by these authors to characterize the
region generally. Bituminous coal was found at Lincoln bay,
half a degree north of the mouth of Lady Franklin sound, on
the east Grinnell land coast, in different parts of the Bellows
valley (which runs inland to the north of the same sound) to
the head, and in the neighbourhood of Lake Hazen, to the westward,
by Capt. Greely. Lieut. Brainard also describes in an
appendix a fossil forest discovered by him in Archer fiord, a
few miles west of Cape Baird, which, with the associated rocks,
is without doubt referable to the Tertiary. Toward the head of
Chandler fiord (running west of Lady Franklin sound) Greely
mentions high cliffs of ‘schistose slate,’ and in Ruggles river,
the outlet of Lake Hazen, large slabs of ‘slate,’ which had been
used by the Eskimos in building their huts. Brainard speaks
of the cliffs of Beatrix bay as dark, those of Ella bay as very
light, in colour. These bays constitute the termination of
Archer fiord. He remembers the cliffs on Musk-ox valley to
have been again of dark colours. Respecting Greely fiord, on
the west coast of Grinnell land, he quotes from his diary: ‘On
the north shore of this fiord the line of cliffs presents a feature
of marked peculiarity; horizontal lines or strata of different
colours run uniformly for miles along their face.’ He adds:
‘The predominating colours in these lines and of the cliffs was
a pale-yellow. On the south side, where we were camped, the
cliffs were of about the same colour as those spoken of above,
but the strata were not noticed. They were from 1,500 to
8,000 feet above the sea-level, and presented a castellated appearance.
Fossils in great numbers were found here.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>To the west of the narrows of Ponds inlet, the high hills of
crystalline rock retreat from the southern shore of the inlet,
leaving a wide plain of stratified sand, gravel and clay, which
extends far to the west and southwest, and is penetrated by a
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>
number of deep bays on that side of the inlet. This plain is
indented by all the water-courses traversing it, and in the beds
of the principal streams broken lignite is found, evidently fallen
from beds of that mineral in the banks above. The presence
of lignite in these stratified deposits points to their being Tertiary
in age, and corresponding with the northern areas of this
formation already described as lying undisturbed in the wide
valleys of the older rocks. This area in the northern part of
Baffin island is, according to the natives, quite extensive, and
probably extends in a southwest direction to the lowlands of
the northern and western sides of Fox channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Capt. Adams, of the whaler <span class='it'>Diana</span>, said that lignite was to
be found in similar deposits near Cape Hay, on the east side of
Bylot island, and also at Durban island on the eastern coast of
Baffin island. There is little doubt that other areas of these
Tertiary deposits occur on the Arctic islands, but owing to no
lignite or fossils having been found in them they have not been
separated from the drift and newer Post Tertiary deposits of
sand, gravel and clay of these coasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Tertiary deposits were laid down on the lands of the
western side of Hudson bay, there is little chance of more than
small protected areas having escaped the intense glaciation to
which the western shores of the bay were subjected. Any such
remaining areas are now probably hidden beneath the mantle
of drift so universal on the low lying portions of this region.</p>

<h2>POST TERTIARY.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Little or no attention was given by the earlier explorers to
the markings of ice-striae and other glacial phenomena, and the
only records of the movement of the glacial ice noted by them
was the distribution of erratic boulders. These observations
have been summarized by Dawson as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘Along the Arctic
coast, and among the islands of the archipelago, there is a considerable
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
volume of evidence to show that the main direction
of movement of erratics was northward. Thus, boulders of
granite supposed by Prof. Haughton to be derived from North
Somerset are found 100 miles to the northeastward, and pebbles
of granite, identical with that of Granite point, also in North
Somerset, occur 135 miles to the northwest. The east side of
King-William land is also said to be strewn with boulders like
the gneiss of Montreal island, to the southward. Prof. Haughton
shows the direction and distance of travel of some of these
fragments by arrows on his geological map of the Arctic
archipelago, and reverts to the same subject on pages 393-394,
pointing out the general northward movement of ice indicated,
and referring the carriage of the boulders to floating ice of the
glacial period.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Near Princess Royal island, in Prince of Wales strait, and
also on the coast of Prince of Wales island, the copper said to
be picked up in large masses by the Eskimos may be supposed
to be derived from the Cambrian rocks of the Coppermine river
region to the south, as it is not probable that it occurs in place
anywhere in the region of horizontal limestone where it is
found.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Dr. Armstrong, previously quoted, notes the occurrence of
granitic and other crystalline rocks, not only on the south shore
of Baring land, but also on the hills inland. These, from what
is known of the region, can scarcely be supposed to have come
from elsewhere than the continental land to the southward.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘In an account of the scientific results of the <span class='it'>Polaris</span> expedition,
it is stated of the west coast of Smith sound, north of the
Humboldt glacier, that “wherever the locality was favourable
the land is covered by drift, sometimes containing very characteristic
lithological specimens, the identification of which with
rocks of South Greenland was a very easily accomplished task.
For instance, garnets of unusual large size were found in latitude
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>
81° 30´, having marked mineralogical characters by which
the identity of some garnets from Tiskernaces was established.
Drawing a conclusion from such observations, it became evident
that the main line of the drift, indicating the direction of its
motion, runs from south to north.” ’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Bell in his report on the geology of Hudson bay and
Hudson strait, 1885, draws attention to the flow of the ice from
the land on both sides of the strait into that body of water,
while the striæ on the islands in the strait show that a great
stream of ice passed eastward through the strait from Hudson
bay into the north Atlantic. These observations have since
been confirmed by observations of the striæ on other islands of
the strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tyrrell’s observations on the glacial phenomena of the barren-land
region west of Hudson bay show that the country was
intensely glaciated; that the centre of glaciation was on a nearly
level plain now elevated some 400 or 500 feet above sea-level,
there being no evidence to show that it was much more elevated
during the period of glaciation. The centre of ice distribution
was situated close to the western shores of Hudson bay, and the
moisture sufficient to allow of such an accumulation of ice was
probably derived from an open Arctic sea. The glacier moved
south and southwest from this centre up a gradual grade to
Manitoba, where morainic accumulations are found on the summits
of the Duck mountains at elevations from 1,800 to 2,400
feet above present sea-level. Striæ evidently formed by moving
ice from this centre have been found by Dr. Barlow and the
writer on the branches of the Moose river to the south of James
bay, where the movement was from the northwest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is little doubt that the ice also moved northward from
the centre of glaciation, and that the evidence quoted above of
the erratics found in the western Arctic islands is proof of
this.
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>From a study of the different sets of glacial striæ, Tyrrell
concluded that the centre of glaciation was, in the early part of
the glacial period, somewhere to the north and west of the head
of Chesterfield inlet; that later, when the ice increased in thickness,
the centre of dispersion moved to a position southwest of
Baker lake; while as the glacier diminished the centre moved
nearer the seashore, and the final stage was probably represented
by the ice-cap breaking up into a number of distinct
glaciers, each with local movement of its own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These conclusions of Tyrrell as to the southern movement of
the centre of glaciation are borne out by the writer’s observations
of the striæ along the shores of Roes Welcome, where as
many as six sets of striæ were found at Whale point, the usual
number being three. The oldest set, found only at Whale point,
showed that the ice movement was from the northwest. The
next in age were from N. 50° E., or almost at right angles to
the oldest; following in order of age come striæ from N. 25°
E., N., N. 30° W., and N.W. The last three sets are found in
a number of places between Winchester inlet and Whale point;
the others only at Whale point. The direction of the above sets
of striæ apparently shows that the earliest accumulation of ice
in the region north of the western side of Hudson bay was somewhere
to the northwest; this was followed by an abrupt change
in the ice-movement, which was next from almost northeast,
after which the centre of movement of the ice-cap gradually
shifted, by way of north, to northwest. It would also appear
that the centres of dispersion were much greater in area than
the limits placed upon them by Tyrrell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This southern movement of the centre of dispersion of the
ice is diametrically opposite to what occurred in the case of the
ice-cap of Labrador, where the striæ along the east side of Hudson
bay show that the centre of ice-movement changed from a
position near the central area of the peninsula, a short distance
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>
north of the southern watershed, to one some three hundred
miles north, in the vicinity of the headwaters of the Koaksoak
river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glaciation of Labrador seems to have been later than
that of the western side of Hudson bay, as the striæ from the
western glacier are almost obliterated by those from the east
and northeast along the rivers south of James bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a marked difference in the evidence of the intensity
of glacial action between the southern regions and the eastern
and northern portions of the great area embraced in this report.
On the shores and islands of Hudson bay and Hudson strait the
crystalline rocks have been denuded of every trace of rotted
surface material; they have been smoothed, polished and intensely
striated, and their present condition is such that little
or no change has taken place since the disappearance of the ice,
which once covered them deeply, the striæ being so fresh as to
appear of the formation of yesterday. When the eastern mouth
of Hudson strait is left, a change is soon seen in following the
eastern side of Baffin island northward. The hills are less
rounded, and talus lies on the slopes of the cliffs; about Cumberland
gulf and Cyrus Field bay there is evidence of a universal
ice-cap having been present, but the rounding, polishing and
striation of the rocks are markedly less than to the south and
westward. In these places it is exceedingly difficult to find
striæ upon the rock surfaces, and these when found show that
the movement was local and from the highlands towards the
open sea. In the northern part of Baffin island the hills become
more serrated in outline, and many of the higher points appear
to have never been subjected to glaciation, the glaciers having
only filled the valleys; if an ice-cap existed the ice-movement
to the coast was determined by the course of the local
valleys, and there is no evidence of a movement not depending
upon local conditions as is the case in the region about Hudson
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>
bay. At Erik harbour, on the south side of the mouth of Ponds
inlet, there is evidence that the glacier which now terminates
at the head of the harbour once extended five miles farther seaward,
and filled the valley to a height of 400 feet above the
present level of the sea. Above that height the rocky walls of
the harbour are not glaciated, and are covered by slopes of disintegrated
rock. Passing north of Lancaster sound to the south
of North Devon, there is little evidence to show that the glaciation
was ever much more severe than at present. At Cuming
creek, a narrow fiord cut some twelve miles into the limestone
cliffs, there is evidence that a glacier once covered its bottom,
and rose some two or three hundred feet above the present level
of the sea; but it was purely local, and the limestone cliffs
everywhere show that they have been long subjected to subaerial
denudation, and that the broken rock covering their sides has
never been displaced by ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very little time was given to the study of glaciation at Cape
Sabine, and the only evidence to show that it was more intense
formerly was a low moraine in the rear of Peary’s house at Payer
harbour. Schei, who devoted considerable attention to the glaciation
of Ellesmere, is of the opinion that the ice covering
never greatly exceeded its present limits, if it did so at all.</p>

<h2>MARINE TERRACES.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Marine terraces are found along the coasts of the northern
mainland and islands wherever the conditions are suitable.
Fronting the highlands about Wager inlet and Repulse bay, on
the western side of Hudson bay, terraces are found cut into the
drift deposits up to elevations varying from 500 to 700 feet.
The highest terrace seen by Dr. Bell on the north side of Hudson
strait had an elevation of 528 feet above the present sea-level.
At Cape Wolstenholme, on the south side of the western
entrance to Hudson strait the terraces rise to 800 feet above the
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
sea. At Douglas harbour on the same side and near the middle
of the strait the highest terraces noted were little over 400 feet.
Along the eastern shores of Baffin island terraces were constantly
seen, which were estimated to rise from 500 to 700 feet
above the sea. Schei found terraces with Post-Pliocene fossils
at an elevation of 650 feet along the shores of Ellesmere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The foregoing evidence shows that at the close of the period
of maximum glaciation an uplift occurred to the land throughout
the northeastern Arctic region. This uplift is marked by
the terraces existing on all the shores, but they fail to agree
with the theory that the uplift was greatest where the accumulation
of ice was greatest. There appears to be no great
difference in the height of the terraces in Ellesmere, where the
glaciation, never excessive, remains in nearly the same state as
when it was at its maximum thickness and of those about the
shores of Hudson bay, where an enormous thickness of ice once
covered the land and has now entirely disappeared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The uplift, which took place in comparatively recent times,
geologically speaking, does not appear to be going on at present,
as all the historical evidence relating to the Hudson bay region
points to a remarkable stability in the coastal regions from the
time of the first records dating back to the voyage of Munck in
1619.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present glacial conditions of the Arctic islands has been
noted in another part of this report, and it need only be here
stated that the lands fronting upon Hudson bay and Hudson
strait are now free from glaciers, the nearest approach being
the occurrence of detached snow banks in protected positions,
which remain throughout the year. The most southern glacier
is the Grinnell glacier situated on the north side of the high
land separating Hudson strait from Frobisher bay, and plainly
seen crowning the summit of the north shore of Hudson strait
for a distance of more than fifty miles. This glacier is not very
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>
active, and is said to discharge only a few small icebergs into
one of the fiords on the south side of Frobisher bay. Passing
northward along the eastern coast of Baffin island, the snow
patches upon the hills become larger and more numerous, but it
is not until Cumberland gulf is passed that real glaciers appear
in the valleys leading down to the sea. These are not very
active, and seldom shed icebergs except on the northern part
of the island. Active glaciers are found along the southern
side of North Devon westward to the neighbourhood of Cuming
creek, west of which the ice-cap retreats, and the shores
and cliffs are free of ice. The valleys of the eastern and southeastern
coasts of Ellesmere are filled with active glaciers that
discharge many large icebergs. In the southwestern part the
glaciers are not very active, and usually terminate at a considerable
distance from the sea.</p>

<h2>ECONOMIC MINERALS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>With the exception of the area of iron-bearing rocks on the
islands along the east coast of Hudson bay, no systematic prospecting
has been done for minerals in the wide region covered
by this report. Active mining at the present is confined to a
mine of mica, situated at Lake harbour, on the north side of
Hudson strait, a few miles east of Big island. Earlier mining
consisted of the extraction of small quantities of coal from the
outcrops of that mineral on Melville and Ellesmere islands by
expeditions wintering there. Our knowledge of the minerals
extends only to the chance observations of the earlier explorers,
and to the hurried examinations made by members of the staff
of the Geological Survey in the southern parts of the region
under consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The occurrence of Laurentian and Huronian rocks over large
portions of the area, both on the islands and mainland, leads to
the belief that important mineral deposits exist there in the
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>
same manner as in more southern regions of similar rocks; in
fact, specimens of the more important minerals are reported
from the north.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Gold.</span>—The occurrence of gold is reported only from the head
of Wager inlet, where specimens of free gold were found in the
dark rocks of that locality by Dr. Rae.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The presence of large areas of undisturbed Tertiary sands
and clays in the northern part of Baffin island and elsewhere
are favourable to the accumulation of placer gold deposits, if
the precious metal occurs in the underlying Laurentian and
Huronian rocks. It would be well to test the beds of the streams
flowing through these deposits when they are again visited.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Silver.</span>—A small quantity of silver is found in the galena,
which occurs in pockets in the limestone along the Whale river
coast on the east side of Hudson bay. The amount of galena
is small, and so widely scattered that it would probably be unprofitable
to mine even in favourable circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Copper.</span>—Tyrrell discovered large masses of Huronian rocks
along the western shores of Hudson bay, to the south of Marble
island. In these were many bands and masses of dark schists,
all carrying quantities of iron and copper sulphides. Of these
deposits he reports as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'>‘At a point northeast of Rabbit
island the character of the shore changes, and dark-green
Huronian schists crop out from beneath the boulders.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘North of Rabbit island is a high point, on which the
Eskimos are accustomed to camp while waiting for the traders
from Churchill. The point is composed of green calcareous,
chloritic schist, striking S. 55° W., and dipping N. 35° W. at
an angle of 60°. The schist is cut by a dike seventy-five feet
wide, of massive green, highly altered diabase, containing a
large amount of mispickel. This diabase also outcrops along
the shore, where it incloses many bands of schists.’
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>‘The rock at the point south of Corbett inlet is a massive
green, fine or medium-grained diabase, which is now almost
entirely altered into a mass of chlorite, epidote, zoisite and calcite.————This
diabase is cut by many small veins of quartz
and calcite, which contain large quantities of pyrite, arseno-pyrite
and chalcopyrite.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘From Term point westward the shore is rocky, and the steep
rocky cliffs descend into rather deep water. The rock is a dark-green
diabase almost entirely altered to sausserite, and is cut
by many veins of quartz and calcite, holding copper-pyrites.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘On the northern shore of Mistake bay, nine miles west of
Term point, is a long point of similar diabase. Seven miles
further southwest, about the middle of the west shore of Mistake
bay, is a high point of similar dark-green diabase, containing
in many places a large amount of copper-pyrites, and cut by
small veins of quartz studded with iron pyrites.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>‘Two miles south of Sir Biddy island is a prominent rocky
point, with a high rocky island lying a short distance off it.
From this prominent point the shore turns westward, and is
bold and rocky, being composed of dark-green fine-grained diabase,
studded with copper-pyrites.’</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The above extracts from Tyrrell’s report show that on his
hurried journey southward from Chesterfield inlet he found
Huronian rocks occupying the shores of the bay for a distance
of nearly a hundred miles. At haphazard landings along this
shore traces of copper deposits were found in a number of
places, and these would point to important discoveries as likely
to follow systematic search on this area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A considerable amount of magnetic pyrites was found in the
squeezed diabase rocks along the east coast of Hudson bay, but
careful analyses failed to show any contained gold, nickel or
copper in a number of specimens from various localities on that
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>
coast, and it is highly probable that no important deposits will
be found in the basic rocks of that side of the bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Small quantities of copper-pyrites were observed in the diabase
schists of the south side of Hudson strait, but never in
sufficient amounts to constitute mines of that mineral.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was informed by Captain Adams, of the whaler <span class='it'>Diana</span>, that
he had picked up specimens of copper ore lying loose on the
surface a few miles in rear of Clyde river on the east coast of
Baffin island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Among the specimens brought home by Hall from Frobisher
and Cyrus Field bays, in the southeast part of Baffin island,
were bornite and pyrite, showing that copper ores also occur in
that portion of the island.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Iron.</span>—Mention has been made of the iron ores on the west
shores of Ungava bay, on the north side of Payne river. The
rocks in which these ores are found have been altered by the
intrusion of granites. They now consist of quartzites, mica-hornblende
schist and crystalline limestone, and are the metamorphic
representatives of the unaltered iron-bearing rocks of
the interior of Labrador peninsula and the east coast of Hudson
bay. In localities where the rocks are unaltered the iron
ores occur either as carbonates in a cherty rock, or as a mixture
of magnetite and hematite intimately associated with chert
and jasper. At Payne river the iron-bearing beds have a thickness
of 420 feet. The upper 70 feet is a light-yellow, fine
granular quartzite containing patches of ankerite and lime.
Towards the top the rock shades to a dark bluish-gray, from
the presence of large quantities of magnetite in small flattened
grains, together with small scales of specular iron. These are
usually mixed with quartz with evidence of foliation, and at
other places are in large masses of nearly pure ore. Underlying
these beds is 350 feet of dark-bluish slaty quartzite holding considerable
magnetite and hematite, and shading upwards into a
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
barren quartzite. Most of the ore of this locality would probably
require separation and concentration from the admixed
quartz before being of a grade sufficiently high for smelting.
The position of the deposits on the west side of Ungava bay,
where the tide rises and falls forty feet or more, is not very
promising for shipping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More attention has been given to the iron deposits of the east
side of Hudson bay than to any other of the mineral deposits
of the north. In 1877, Dr. Bell explored the east shore of
Hudson bay as far north as Cape Dufferin, and in his report on
this exploration called attention to the deposits of iron ore
found in a bedded series of rocks, chiefly sandstones, cherts and
dolomites. These rocks he found forming the islands along that
coast from Cape Jones, at the mouth of James bay, to Cape
Dufferin, some 300 miles farther north. A strip of the same
rocks occupies the mainland from the vicinity of Great Whale
river to beyond the head of Richmond gulf, a distance of 120
miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The iron ores of value were found to be confined to the
Nastapoka chain of islands, which extend northward from
Little Whale river for a distance of 100 miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A further examination of these iron-bearing rocks was made
by the writer during the summers of 1898 and 1899, and more
closely during the summers of 1901 and 1902 when engaged in
this work for a private company.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These iron-bearing rocks of the east side of Hudson bay have
a close resemblance to those of Lake Superior, so famous for
the amount and quality of their associated ores of iron. They
consist of bedded sandstones, cherts, shales, graywackes and
dolomites, associated with great outflows and sills of trap. The
following general section of the rocks of the Nastapoka islands
will give a good idea of the rocks there, while on the mainland
other strata, free from or poor in iron, are found.

<p class='pindent'>The iron ores have a greater thickness and are richer on the
islands in the middle of the chain than elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rusty weathering, dark-gray siliceous rocks of division
I. are found on all the islands from Flint to McTavish,
being wanting only on Cotter island. The typical rock is a
dark-gray chert made up of finely divided silica showing
under the microscope small grains of quartz filled in by
later accessions of that material in a finely divided state. It
contains minute crystals of magnetite scattered through the
mass, and also patches of crystalline carbonates. At the southern
end of the chain it is cherty and sometimes light-green in
colour. These rocks are usually in thin beds, the parting
between the beds filled with brownish ankerite, which also
occurs in flat lenticular masses inclosed in the cherts; many of
these masses are several inches in thickness and several square
feet in area, so that the rock usually contains from twenty to
fifty per cent of ankerite. These ores are too much broken and
too intimately mixed with the cherts for profitable mining. The
rusty character of the rock is due to surface decomposition of
ankerite to limonite. The beds increase in thickness as the
islands are followed northward, and reach their maximum
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>
development on Davieau island and northward to McTavish
island, where they have a thickness of fifty feet. These
measures can be traced southward from the Nastapoka chain in
the outer islands lying along the coast for upward of 150 miles,
being last seen on Long island just north of Cape Jones, where
they are overlaid by a considerable thickness of trap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second division of the section is an arbitrary one, and
was made to embrace all the beds containing important deposits
of magnetite. The upper beds of the division grade into those
of division I, while the lower pass gradually into division III.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The typical rock of these measures is a dark-gray, fine-grained
variety of quartzite chert, containing considerable magnetite
scattered through it in minute crystals; it also contains
small quantities of carbonates of iron, magnesia and lime. The
beds are usually thin (from one to twelve inches) and the partings
between them are filled with a mixture of silica and
magnetite with small quantities of ankerite. These partings
vary in thickness, but are generally thin between the upper beds
of the division, and quite thick (six inches to forty-eight
inches) towards the bottom, where they form important ores of
iron; as the beds of chert are often quite thin between two or
more thick partings of ore, they might easily be neglected in
mining. The mixture of silica and magnetite in the ore is an
intimate one, with the silica usually in a finely divided state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proportion of these substances is not constant, so that the
ores vary from a lean ferruginous chert to a rich ore containing
upwards of sixty per cent of iron. Large quantities of the better
ores occur in the lower beds of the division. The occurrence of
these ores between the beds of gray siliceous rock, and their intimate
association with finely divided silica, point to their
deposition and enrichment from the infiltrations of waters
carrying solutions of iron and silica which were deposited in
the waters in cracks and between the bedding of the already-formed
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>
siliceous rocks. This mode of formation has been
described by Van Hise for similar ores in the Lake Superior
region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the three southern islands of the chain there is a gradual
change in the nature of these measures. They pass into a
brownish-black siliceous shale, rich in iron and containing considerable
carbon as small scales of graphite. This is the form
in which they are found to the southward on the islands as far
as Long island. The thickness of the division is very constant
on the islands northward to McTavish, but it does not occur on
Cotter island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rocks belonging to the third division, as before stated,
grade into the division above them, and the line between them
cannot be drawn sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The typical rock of the division is fine-grained and very
siliceous, with minute particles of silica coated with red oxide
of iron, forming a coarse impure red jasper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These jasper rocks usually occur in thin broken bands, the
partings between them being filled with a finely-divided mixture
of hematite, magnetite and jasper. The hematite is greatly in
excess of the magnetite. The association of the iron ores and
the jasper is intimate, and they must have been deposited simultaneously
from aqueous solutions probably leached from the
cherty carbonate measures above. Microscopic sections from
these rocks are almost identical with those of jaspilite figured
by Van Hise in his monograph on the iron-bearing rocks of the
Lake Superior region; and they must have had the same origin
that he has assigned to these rocks, namely, enrichments
deposited by water subsequent to the formation of the bedded
rocks in which they are found as partings, and filling the most
minute cavities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The amount of ore in this admixture of hematite and jasper
varies greatly. Where the ore is poor, the jaspery rock predominates
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>
and incloses lenses of hematite, while where the
hematite is most plentiful it incloses similar lenses of jasper.
The detailed description of these rocks shows that the
measures of this division contain an immense amount of
hematite. The rocks of the division do not occur on all the
islands, being wanting on Flint, Belanger and Ross. On
Anderson they are represented by a few thin beds not rich in
ore, while on Clarke they form the summit of the section with
a thickness of eighty feet. They reach their maximum development
on Gillies and Taylor, where their ores are richest and
most concentrated. Farther northward they become thinner
and poorer in ore, being twenty feet thick on Davieau and only
eight feet thick on McTavish, where they die out. No trace of
these measures is found underlying the upper rocks on the
islands south of the Nastapoka group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth division, consisting of red jaspilites, is an
arbitrary one, of use only as a subdivision of the iron-bearing
rocks. Wherever the jaspilites are well developed the richer
beds are underlain with leaner measures, unfit for working, and
these poorer ores constitute this division. On Clarke island
these beds are twenty feet thick; on Gillies they vary from ten
to twenty feet in thickness, on Taylor they are ten feet, while
to the northward they merge into the overlying division, all
poor in iron ores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The richest ores are found in division III, where extensive
beds several feet in thickness are found containing ore practically
free from jasper, and ranging in iron values from thirty
per cent to sixty per cent. Most of these ores, however, would
require separation from the bands and lenses of jasper before
becoming sufficiently rich to be economically treated in the
furnace. The position of the ores on the islands separated from
the mainland by a sound varying from a mile to four miles in
width, with excellent, almost tideless, harbours, constitute ideal
conditions for shipment. The mining of the ores would also be
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
easy and cheap, if advantage were taken of the great waterpower
of the Nastapoka river, which falls 160 feet into the sea
within a few miles of the best ore deposits, and from which
electrical power might be generated easily and cheaply. Owing
to the distance of these ores from the nearest furnaces, and the
want of experience in the navigation of Hudson strait, the shipment
of them is at present out of the question. No coal is found
in Hudson bay, so that economical smelting near the mines
cannot be attempted, until electrical smelting becomes practicable
some time in the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all the fields where extensive areas of iron-bearing rocks
occur in the Lake Superior region, the search by drilling has
disclosed large deposits of concentrated ore, and there is little
doubt that such a search in the Hudson bay region would lead
to similar discoveries, as the manner in which the ores occur is
favourable for such concentrations.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Mica.</span>—Active mining operations for mica are being carried
on at Lake harbour, on the north side of Hudson strait. This
mine is being worked in connection with the whaling steamer
<span class='it'>Active</span>. A number of white men are brought to the place from
Scotland in the early summer, who, with the assistance of the
Eskimos, work the mine, and then return home in the fall. Last
summer thirteen tons of excellent mica were taken out in this
manner. Other deposits of this mineral will probably be found
on that coast to the westward in association with the crystalline
limestones so largely developed there. A mica mine was opened
some years ago on the west side of Cumberland gulf, but for
some reason was shortly after abandoned.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Graphite.</span>—Extensive bands, or veins, of this mineral were
discovered by Mr. Caldwell to the south of Port Burwell along
the east shore of Ungava bay. Graphite has also been found in
the neighbourhood of Cape Wolstenholme, and along the east
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>
side of Baffin island, but no attempt has been made to develop
any of the outcrops.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Molybdenite.</span>—Flattened crystals of molybdenite have been
found in many localities in the pegmatite veins penetrating the
Laurentian rocks, but in no place has the quantity been sufficient
for mining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is no doubt that the combined areas of Carboniferous
and Tertiary coals are very extensive, and that they would form
a valuable addition to the mineral wealth of the Dominion if
they were located in a more accessible region. Situated as they
are in the northern Arctic islands, where navigation is at all
times uncertain and unusually perilous, it is very doubtful if
they will ever prove of economic value.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Lignite.</span>—Attention has been drawn to the occurrence of
lignite of an excellent quality in the sand and clay deposits of
Tertiary age along the northern and eastern shores of Baffin
island and on the east side of Bylot island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little is known of these deposits, as the only information
concerning them is derived from small float specimens picked
from the beds of the streams that flow over these sands and
clays. These lignites probably correspond to the bituminous
coal found in the folded Tertiary rocks of the far north, and
may prove to be quite extensive and of economic value, as the
localities at which they have been found, although within the
Arctic circle, are by no means so dangerous of access as the coal
beds of the north.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Coal.</span>—The presence of extensive deposits of coal on the
island north of Lancaster sound has already been mentioned in
the discussion of the Carboniferous and Tertiary formations of
the northern islands. The Carboniferous rocks cover all the
western islands of the Parry group, and extend northwesterly
into the northwest part of Ellesmere. Parry first discovered
coal in the cliffs at Winter harbour on Melville island, and used
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
it for fuel on his ships. The Franklin search parties later
found outcrops of coal in other places along the southern and
eastern shores of that island and in the cliffs of Bathurst island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These outcrops of coal indicate that the seams seen in the
southern cliffs will be found extending inland over the greater
portion of the islands, where they are covered by several
hundred feet of newer rocks. No coal has been found in the
Carboniferous rocks of Ellesmere island.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mineral occurs in thin beds along with sandstones and
shales, and is a good quality of bituminous coal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the folded Tertiary rocks found in the vicinity of Lady
Franklin sound on the west side of Kennedy channel several
outcrops of excellent bituminous coal have been discovered. The
beds in the neighbourhood of Fort Conger have been mined
along the outcrop and used for fuel by the Nares expedition and
by Greely and Peary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pursuit of the Right whale in the Arctic seas calls into
play all the instincts and resources of the hunter; the dangers
of ice and climate add zest to the chase, while the value
of the quarry is the incentive which has brought forth all the
daring and ingenuity of the whaler in his efforts to capture this
most valuable and wary animal, and has caused him to assume
risks unequalled in any other calling. The capture of a single
whale repays the expenditure incurred in outfitting a steam
whaling ship, and if more than one is killed on the voyage, it
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>
means large dividends to the owners and small ones to the
officers and crew of the ship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Several species of whales are found in the waters of the
northern ice-laden seas, but there is only one prize, known
amongst other common names as the Greenland whale, Right
whale and Bowhead whale, and scientifically called the <span class='it'>Balaena
mysticetus</span>, L. From its mouth is obtained the precious whalebone.
An average whale carries nearly a ton of this material,
which at present is worth about $15,000 a ton, with the price
rising from year to year. The principal uses of the whalebone
are to stiffen the bodices of the better-made gowns, and to weave
into expensive silk fabrics. The wealth of the world is increasing
and the supply of whales is decreasing; no idea, therefore,
can be formed of the value of whalebone in the future, as no
good substitute has been discovered. An adult female whale
will furnish blubber sufficient for nearly thirty tons of oil, while
a male will supply about twenty tons; the value of oil also is
on the increase, and may be taken at about $100 per ton. Thus,
the total value of a large whale varies from $15,000 to $20,000,
but even at that the chase is becoming unprofitable, owing to
the few whales remaining, and to the frequent ‘empty’ voyages
made of late years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whaling ‘grounds’ of the eastern side of America are
situated in Davis strait and Baffin bay and in the northern
parts of Hudson bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The memorable voyage of Baffin, in 1616, first showed the
value of the whale fishery of Davis strait, and as early as 1619
the first Dutch whaler was fishing in those waters. A few years
later they were joined by British whaling vessels, but their
operations were confined to the waters off the south coast of
Greenland for nearly two hundred years, until the voyages of
Ross and Parry disclosed the more valuable waters of Baffin bay
and of the western side of Davis strait.
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>These discoveries led to a rapid increase of the British whaling
fleet, and vessels were fitted out from the ports of Hull,
Dundee, Kirkcaldy, Peterhead, Fraserburg and Aberdeen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The introduction of steamships in the early sixties, and the
combination of the whale fishery with the sealing industry of
Newfoundland and eastern Greenland, led to further increases
in the fleet, which, in 1868, totalled thirty steam and sailing
vessels as follows: Dundee, 13 steam and 1 sailing ship; Peterhead,
4 steam and 8 sailing ships; Fraserburg, 2 sailing ships;
Aberdeen, 1 sailing ship; Hull, 1 steamship. This was the last
year in which ships sailed from Hull; since then the British
whaling fleet has been from Scotch ports only. Steam soon altogether
replaced sails, so that in 1877 only the former was
employed. The fleet at that time had been reduced to thirteen
vessels, all sailing from the port of Dundee. No new ships have
been built during the past twenty-five years, and the construction
of these strong oak vessels, sheathed with greenheart or
ironbark, is fast becoming a lost art in these days of steel and
iron ships. The Dundee fleet is now reduced to five, without
much prospect of their being replaced by British-built ships.
The future ships of the whaling fleet will probably be Norwegian-built.
Four of the above vessels were, in 1904, whaling
in Baffin bay, the fifth was in Hudson bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American whalers did not attempt Arctic whaling until
1846, and have since confined their operations to the waters on
the west side of Davis strait (Cumberland gulf and southward)
and to those of Hudson strait and Hudson bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The American ships have always been sailing vessels, and the
American methods differ considerably from those of the Scotch
whalers, the chief difference being that their ships are provisioned
for two years, and remain one or two winters in the
north on each voyage. Americans were the first to erect permanent
stations in the eastern Arctics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The attention of the Hudson’s Bay Company was early
directed to the whale fishery of Hudson bay. In 1719 a frigate
and sloop, under the command of Knight, were despatched from
Churchill, to explore the western shores of the bay to the northward
and to prosecute the whale fishery in those waters. The
disastrous ending of this venture, the entire crews dying of
scurvy and starvation on Marble island, put a stop to all projects
of the Company as regards whale fishing, until one was
undertaken in recent years, but so little success attended the
venture that it was abandoned after three years’ trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Public attention was first called to the whale fishery of Hudson
bay by Dr. Rae, in the publications on his voyages in 1846
and 1854 along the northwestern coast of the bay in search of
traces of the Franklin expedition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1860 the first American ships visited the northwestern
part of Hudson bay, wintered there, and returned with full
cargoes. Their success led other whalers to the same waters, so
that in 1864 there were fourteen American ships in Hudson
bay and Cumberland strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whaling in Hudson bay has since been almost wholly in the
hands of the Americans, and an idea of the value taken by them
from those waters may be obtained from the tabulated statement
at the end of this article.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first British vessel of modern times to visit Hudson bay
for whales was the Newfoundland steamer <span class='it'>Nimrod</span>, which,
according to Hall, was at Repulse bay in 1867. The Scotch
steamer <span class='it'>Arctic</span> made two or three voyages to the bay, the last
being in 1897, when she struck a rock in Hudson strait, and
was damaged to such an extent that she subsequently sunk in
Cumberland gulf. The Hudson’s Bay Company’s ship <span class='it'>Perseverance</span>,
already alluded to, was in Hudson bay from 1894
to 1896, and only took five small whales. Changing hands, a
couple of years later, this ship was at Cumberland gulf, and
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
sailing from there for Scotland must have struck an iceberg, as
no tidings have since been had of her. This, or being crushed
in the ice or being wrecked by striking sunken rocks upon these
uncharted coasts, is the usual fate of the whaling vessels, and
some such loss, entailing excessive hardships and often death
upon the crews, is almost an annual occurrence in these Arctic
waters, so that a high rate of remuneration is necessary to compensate
for the risks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since 1898 the Scotch steamer <span class='it'>Active</span> has made annual voyages
to Hudson bay, and has established two stations, one on
the north side of Hudson strait and the other first at Southampton
island, but later removed to Repulse bay. Walrus hunting
was the first object of this undertaking, with whaling as a
secondary consideration. Success appears to have crowned this
enterprise, as in addition to a few whales, a goodly number of
walrus are taken annually, and the profits of these are enhanced
by the furs obtained from the natives, and by mica from a mine
worked on the north shore of Hudson strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whaling in Hudson bay appears to have reached its height
about 1870, after which the disappearance of the whales from
the more accessible waters led to a diminution of the catch, and
many of the American whaling vessels were transferred to the
Arctic whaling waters reached from the Pacific, which were
also discovered and made known by the British ships in search
of the ill-fated Franklin. At present only one of the American
whalers is in Hudson bay, and none of them have visited Cumberland
gulf for some years past; the only connection with the
industry now on that coast is the small and unprofitable station
at Cape Haven, on Cyrus Field bay, owned by a firm in
Boston.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The movements of the whales appear to depend largely upon
the ice of these northern waters, and that in turn is modified by
the currents and configuration of the seas, so that a short geographical
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
description is necessary to a proper understanding of
the movements and habits of these animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Davis strait and Baffin bay separate Greenland from the
great Arctic islands of Baffin, Bylot, North Devon and Ellesmere.
Their combined length stretches from the mouth of
Hudson strait to the entrance of Smith sound, or from latitude
60° N. to latitude 78° N., a distance of 1,200 miles. In shape
they may be compared to a sack loosely drawn in about a third
of the distance from its mouth, which opens widely to the southward,
where it has a breadth of nearly 500 miles between the
southern part of Greenland and the island of Resolution on the
north side of Hudson strait. Both shores then gradually approach,
until in the neighbourhood of latitude 66° N. the
distance across is 200 miles. To the northward of this the
Greenland coast runs nearly due north, while the western coast
trends towards the northwest, and in consequence when latitude
75° N. is reached Baffin bay is nearly 400 miles wide from the
Greenland coast to the shores of North Devon. Beyond this the
Greenland coast sweeps to the westward, around Melville bay,
and after Cape York is passed turns northwest until Cape
Alexander, at the entrance to Smith sound, is reached. The
western coast, in the meanwhile, first runs north and then northeast
to Cape Isabella, which is only twenty-five miles distant
from Cape Alexander on the Greenland coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like all the great northern bays, Baffin bay has a current
flowing northward along the eastern or Greenland coast, and a
cold Arctic current setting southward along the western shores.
These currents have a considerable influence upon the climate
of the adjoining land, and the mean annual temperature at
points of corresponding latitude is several degrees higher on
the Greenland side. This difference of climate is marked along
the middle and northern coasts, that of Greenland being practically
free from ice and snow, except where glaciers from the
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
great central ice-cap flow down into the sea. The fiords and
bays are open early in summer, while the current sweeps northward
all the ice accumulated along the coast during the winter,
leaving an open sea, usually early in July, as far as Melville
bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A portion of this southern current evidently comes from the
North Atlantic, and the remainder sweeps around the southern
end of Greenland, bringing with it a stream of Arctic ice
brought south on the Arctic current of east Greenland. This
stream of ice is soon deflected from the west coast, and appears
to melt in the southeastern part of Davis strait, as there is a
lane of open water separating the southern ice from that of the
west coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The distance from Wilcox head to Cape York, across Melville
bay, is 180 miles; that from the centre of this line to the head
of the bay is upwards of 100 miles. Much of the shore-line of
the bay is still unexplored, but sufficient is known to state that
it is an almost unbroken line of glaciers, which constantly discharge
large icebergs into the waters of the bay. A large
number of rocky islands break its surface, and the bottom
appears to be very uneven, with much shallow water; in consequence,
many of the icebergs are grounded in the shallower
parts of the bay. The islands and grounded bergs break the
winds and waves, and so allow of the formation of heavy sheets
of ice between them during the winter months, while in the
summer they act as anchors for this sheet, or floe ice. As before
stated, the southerly current carries a great part of the shore ice
of central Greenland north to Melville bay, where it acts as an
aggravation to the congestion of ice there, so that it is always
late in the season before the bay is even partly clear of ice,
which must pass westward, until being influenced by the
northern current from Smith sound, it is deflected south and
goes to increase the great mass of ice known as the ‘middle
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>
pack,’ which all summer fills the southwestern part of Baffin
bay. In the days of sailing ships the whalers made their way
across the bay by tracking, or sailing along the edge of the solid
land-ice, and many a vessel was lost there. Even with steam-power
this is a place of terror to the whalers, and they never
feel safe until they have reached the ‘north water’ at Cape
York. As an illustration of the dangers and difficulties of this
crossing, the <span class='it'>Vega</span> was crushed and sunk in the summer of
1903, and the <span class='it'>Balaena</span> was at the same time eighty days tightly
jammed in the ice. In 1904 the <span class='it'>Eclipse</span> took thirty days to
cross the bay, and the <span class='it'>Diana</span> was thirty-five days in crossing.
The <span class='it'>Neptune</span>, on the 8th of August, crossed in twenty hours,
when little ice was seen until within a few miles of Cape York;
and from there to Cape Alexander, at the entrance to Smith
sound, only ‘pan’ or sheet ice was observed at the heads of
the larger bays, all the eastern side of the northern part of
Baffin bay being free of ice. This open ‘north water’ is caused
as follows: The ice to the southward of Cape Alexander breaks
up towards the end of June or early in July, and is soon carried
southward on the southerly current of the west side. Smith
sound and its continuation northward remain tightly frozen
until August, when it sends its heavy ice southward; in consequence
there is always a wide interval of open water between
these two streams of ice from the north. The Smith sound ice
continues to pour out in heavy floes, often square miles in area,
until the end of the year, and this stream finally joins the
earlier ice in the western part of Baffin bay, where other
streams of Arctic ice gather from Jones, Lancaster and Ponds
inlet sounds. All these form the great mass of the ‘middle pack,’
which slowly empties on the northern current, flowing southward
along the west side of Davis strait, blocking the mouths of
Cumberland gulf and Frobisher bay in the late summer, later
appearing on the coast of Labrador, and finally forming the
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>
heavy pack upon which the seals are found in March and April
off the shores of Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whaling grounds of Hudson bay have been confined to
the north side of Hudson strait and to the northwestern part of
the bay. The great island of Southampton lies in the north
part of the bay and divides it into two unequal portions. The
eastern or Fox channel is by far the larger, extending northward
from latitude 64° to latitude 70°, and exceeds 200 miles
in width. The western, or Roes Welcome, is much smaller; its
length from Cape Fullerton to the head of Repulse bay is 150
miles, while it rarely exceeds 40 miles across.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the early days of the Hudson bay fishery, whales were
plentiful as far south as Marble island, and from there northward
to Repulse bay. Of late years few whales have been taken
in these southern waters, and the whalers now confine themselves
to the southern shores of Southampton and the waters of
Roes Welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The northern and eastern parts of Fox channel are still
unexplored, and owing to the large masses of ice found there
continuously, and to the numerous shoals and reefs in the
known parts, it has never been a favourite place for whalers, its
waters being the only portion of the bay where the whales have
been left undisturbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The favourite resort for whales both in Baffin and Hudson
bays is along the edge of the ice still fast to the shore, with an
abundance of loose ice outside. When the shore ice is all melted
or loosened they prefer to remain about the edge of the large
masses of floating ice. This habit of remaining close to the ice-masses
appears to be due to two causes—food and protection.
The whale is a very timid animal, and is easily frightened by
anything out of the ordinary; it then either takes to the
protection of the tightly packed ice, or leaves for distant parts.
The food of the whale consists of small crustaceans (called sealice
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>
by the whalers), and swimming pterepods known as ‘whale-food’
and ‘blackberries.’ These creatures in turn feed upon
minute animal organisms, known as diatoms, which are found
in countless numbers in these northern waters, where they are
so numerous as to discolour large areas of the sea, giving it a
light-green, or a brownish hue. The diatoms are known to be
propagated in the fresh-water pools upon the large pans of ice,
and it would appear that they thrive best in the comparatively
fresh surface-water in the vicinity of melting ice; this may be
the chief reason for the whales frequenting such localities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whales are known to enter Hudson strait early in the
spring; they have been captured around Big island in April and
May, and at the western end of the strait in the latter part of
May. They then cross to the west side of the bay along the edge
of the open water, being found in June and early July along
the land-floe on both sides of the southern part of Roes Welcome.
As the Welcome clears of ice they proceed north to Repulse bay,
and, still later, pass through Frozen strait into Fox channel.
Late in the autumn they again pass through Hudson strait
going eastward. By far the greater number of whales taken
in Hudson bay have been killed in the vicinity of Whale point
near the southern entrance to the Welcome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some whales are supposed to remain during the winter in
the waters of Hudson bay, as they have been reported by the
Eskimos as being seen in the depth of winter off Mansfield and
some of the more southern islands of the east side of the bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The migration of the whales in Davis strait and Baffin bay is
fairly well known. In March they are found along the edge of
the land-floe of Cumberland gulf and Frobisher bay, where they
remain until the beginning of May, when they cross to the
Greenland coast, and in June are found on the ‘middle ground’
to the south of Disko. From there they follow the shore ice
north to Melville bay, and then cross along the southern edge
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
of the ‘north water’ to the western shores of Baffin bay.
Should there be a good land-floe in Jones and Lancaster sounds,
they are found there late in July and in the beginning of
August, but the greater number go south to the mouth of Ponds
inlet, where the principal summer catch is made. During September
and October they are found along the western edge of
the ‘middle pack,’ and the whalers pass southward from Ponds
inlet, making use of a number of good harbours known only to
themselves on the eastern side of Baffin island, and going out
only in fine weather. According to the season they remain on
that coast, to the northward of Cumberland gulf, until the
middle or end of October, when they leave for Scotland. In
October the whales again enter Cumberland gulf, and remain
along the edge of the newly-formed land ice until December,
when their position is unknown until their return in the following
March. They are supposed to go in the meantime, to the
southward, off the mouth of Hudson strait and along the northern
Atlantic coast of Labrador, but the weather then is too
severe to permit of the use of open whaleboats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Greenland whale, commonly called a ‘fish’ by the
whalers, is, as all know, a mammal, warm-blooded, reproducing
and suckling its young like any of the land mammals. Its outward
resemblance to a fish is merely a provision of nature,
whereby its shape is adapted to the conditions in which it lives;
that is, for a wholly marine life. Its swimming ‘fins’ when
stripped of their covering, are found to correspond to the fore-limbs
of quadrupeds, and although the whale does not possess
any hind-limbs, there are rudiments of such to be found in their
place, or at least the rudiments of the pelvis to which the after
limbs were attached.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In colour the whale is usually black or bluish-black above,
and whitish or piebald below. Sometimes white spots occur on
the upper parts, and the markings frequently vary with the
individual. The young are lighter-coloured, being bluish.
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>An adult whale varies from forty to sixty feet in length;
extra large ones run to sixty-five feet, and the largest recorded
reached eighty feet in length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whalers have different names for differently sized whales.
<span class='it'>Suckers</span> are the young under a year old; <span class='it'>Shortheads</span> is also
applied to the young as long as they continue to be suckled.
<span class='it'>Stunts</span> are two years old; <span class='it'>Scull-fish</span> have bone less than six feet
in length; <span class='it'>Size-fish</span> have the bone exceeding that length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following are the measurements given by Dr. Robert
Goodsir of a large female whale killed in Ponds bay:—</p>

<p class='pindent'>Female whales are larger and fatter than the males, so that
a female will have an average of about ten more tons of blubber
than an ordinary male. As will be seen from the above measurements,
the head equals about a third of the length of the body,
and the upper jaw, which carries the baleen or whalebone, is
only a few feet shorter. The baleen is in the form of thin slabs
or ‘splits’ set close together in the gum at right-angles to the
length of the jaw-bone. At the base the splits are from six to
twelve inches wide and from a quarter to nearly an inch in
thickness. They taper slowly to their free end, and terminate
in long hairs which extend upwards of six inches beyond the
solid bone. Similar hairs are found along the inside of the
bone. There are about 360 of these splits on each side of the
jaw, and they are placed so as to slope backwards. The longest
or ‘size split’ is in the middle of the side of the jaw, and the
others decrease in length in front and behind. It derives its
name from being the split by which the length and weight of
the bone is computed. The longest split recorded measured
fourteen feet in length, but the ordinary length in adult whales
is from nine to ten feet. Bone of that length will average nearly
a ton weight to a whale. Bone six feet and under brings only
half the price of longer bone. The laminæ are usually pale-blue;
in the young they are sometimes green and black; in older
whales nearly black, and occasionally striped white and black.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This bone in the whale’s mouth acts as a swab or sieve to
entangle and collect the small animals upon which it feeds. The
lower lip is very deep, and when closed fits close to the head, the
edge forming a bow as it curves backwards from the front.
When feeding, this lip is let down, so that it projects nearly at
right-angles, forming a sort of trough and conducting the water,
as the whale moves through it, to the tangle of hairs of the
exposed bone. When sufficient food has been collected the lip
is closed and the food removed from the baleen by the broad
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>
tongue. A whale when feeding travels at, or near the surface,
at a rate varying from two to four miles an hour. The speed
at which a free whale travels through the water appears to have
been greatly exaggerated. When harpooned, and dragging a
whaleboat, the speed rarely exceeds six miles an hour, and as
the mass of the whale greatly exceeds that of the boat the latter
cannot to any great extent retard its speed, especially as the
whale is then exerting its utmost power in its efforts to escape.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/260a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_260' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Bundles of Whalebone on the ‘Era.’</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The body is everywhere covered with a thick skin, which
varies from an inch to an inch and a half in thickness. This
thick ‘blackskin’ forms a luxury in the diet of the Eskimos
and whalers. It is eaten boiled, a small amount of blubber being
attached to give it flavour. When cooked it has the appearance
of thick black india-rubber, and is soft and glutinous, while its
flavour approaches that of the clam.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fat or blubber is found everywhere directly below the
skin, and is thickest towards the tail. It bears a resemblance
to very fat pork, and is from twelve to eighteen inches in thickness.
The flesh of the whale is coarse and tough, and is used
largely for dog-food; although often eaten by the Eskimos, it is
only when seal or walrus meat cannot be obtained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whales are gregarious, and when plentiful travel in large
bands, but they are now so rare that a band of three or four is
the greatest number seen together of late years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are two methods employed in the chase after whales.
The Scotch whalers of Baffin bay cruise about in small steamers,
and depend wholly upon their own white crew to man their
boats. The American whalers and the stations depend more or
less upon the Eskimos to form their boats’ crews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Scotch steamers are small, stout vessels, from 300 to 400
tons register. Those, British-built, are of hardwood throughout,
while the Norwegian ships have hardwood frames and softwood
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
planking. The timbers and planking in all are very heavy,
and the sides are further strengthened by a sheathing of greenheart
or ironbark, both exceedingly hard, tough woods. This
sheathing extends from above the water-line to near the keel;
the planks forming it are from three to six inches thick, and
are capable of resisting great pressure from the ice, as well as
withstanding its cutting action which would soon wear through
unprotected sides. The bows are further strengthened by being
backed by several feet of solid timber, while, outside, thick
plates and bands of iron protect the bow and stem. The sides
are also strengthened by a layer of rock-salt, filled in between
the timbers and between the skin of the ship, and by an inside
sheathing fastened to the timber, so that with the outside
sheathing of greenheart, the planking and the salt-filling, the
sides are from eighteen to twenty-four inches thick. Notwithstanding
this great strength, the usual fate of these ships is to
be crushed in the ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The ships are three-masted and barque rigged, differing in
appearance from an ordinary wooden barque by the presence of
large barrels fitted to the tops of the fore and main masts, and
used for observation stations when working the ship through
ice or when chasing whales. The small engine and boiler are
placed aft, between the main and mizzen masts, where the
strong deck beams can be best spared. The engine works a two-bladed
propeller, which drives the ships at rates varying from
four to seven knots an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lower hold of the ship is filled with a number of iron
tanks that rise to the level of the middle deck, and which are
used to store the blubber. On leaving home all these tanks are
filled with coal, which is also stowed in every other available
space, the usual amount of coal for the voyage being from 250
to 300 tons. The between-deck space is used for stowing provisions,
and for the quarters of part of the crew.
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The officers and crew usually number about fifty persons,
sufficient to man six whaleboats and to leave men on board to
work the vessel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boats are narrow, and are pointed at both ends. Their
length is about twenty-six feet. They are propelled by five oars,
or by sail. When rowing the steersman uses a long sweep oar,
and when sailing a rudder, so arranged as to be easily
unshipped and hung on the side of the boat. Scotch whaleboats
are built of larch, while the American are made of cedar.
Another difference is that the latter are centre-board boats,
while the former have fixed keels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whaling grounds the boats hang ready in davits, three
on a side, with all their whaling gear in place, and ready to
be lowered at a moment’s notice. A man is always on the lookout
in the barrel, and when a whale is sighted the captain takes
his place there and directs the movements of the boats from the
ship by signals made with sails and other signs. He is also in
connection with the engine-room, and controls the ship from
that lofty perch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A whale is usually sighted by the column of spray which it
throws up in breathing, and which often rises twenty feet in
the air, accompanied by a puffing sound. A whale usually
spouts or breathes five or six times when it comes to the surface
for that purpose, and so remains up for several minutes. It
then goes down to feed, and remains under the water for fifteen
or twenty minutes, during that time travelling perhaps at most
a mile. If possible, advantage is taken of the wind to approach
the whale, to avoid the noise made in rowing. For that purpose
ordinary metal row-locks are not used, their place being taken
by stout pins, to which the oar is attached by a ‘grummet’ or
loop of rope. Both ear and eye of the whale are very small, but
in the water they are very acute, and any strange noise instantly
arouses suspicion. The eye is so placed that the animal can
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>
only see ahead, and care is therefore taken to approach it from
behind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Scotch whalers use guns, both for the harpoon and for
the bomb, with which the whale is killed after the harpoon is
fast. The harpoon has but one barb, and is so attached to the
shank that when it has entered the skin and the line begins to
pull, it swings at right-angles to the wound, and cannot be
removed without cutting a large hole. The shank is about two
feet long, and is split from the head to butt. In this split runs
a ring to which the line is attached. The butt is a circular disc
the diameter of the bore of the harpoon gun. This gun is
mounted on a stanchion in the bow of the boat, and, working on
a swivel, may be pointed in any direction. It is a muzzle-loader,
and its discharge is insured by a double primer. When the gun
is loaded, only the head of the harpoon and a short length of the
stock protrude, sufficient for the ring with attached line. When
it is fired the ring slips back to the butt and the head is buried
deep into the side of the whale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The harpoon line is generally made of manilla, and has a circumference
of about three inches. It is carefully coiled in tubs
between the seats, each tub holding a line 120 fathoms long.
After the whale has been struck, the line is passed aft and a
turn taken around a post in the stern, from which the line is
payed out as required. The bomb gun has a bore about an inch
in diameter, and fires an explosive shell, so arranged as to
explode shortly after coming in contact with the body of the
whale, and thus well inside. This gun is rarely used before the
whale makes its first plunge, and frequently several dives are
made before the boat can get close enough to give this <span class='it'>coup de
grâce</span>.</p>

<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Preparing for Spring Whaling.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>As soon as life is extinct, the boats form in line and tow the
whale, tail first, to the ship, where its tail is made fast to the
quarter, and an effort is made to reach a harbour, where the carcass
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
may be stripped with safety. When this is impossible, the
body is brought alongside the ship and secured by the head and
tail. Work is then commenced with long-handled blubber
spades, about six inches wide and very sharp. The blubber is
removed in long strips cut around the body, and when one side
is finished the whale is turned over. The great lips are cut
away, and then, with cheers, the prize in the upper jaw is
hoisted on board. The blubber, as it is taken from the whale, is
stored in the empty tanks and is taken home in this condition.
It is not reduced to oil immediately, as is the practice with the
Americans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Scotch whalers of Hudson bay differ in their methods
from those of Baffin bay only in the employment of Eskimos to
man a part of their boats, and consequently they do not carry so
large a white crew. The natives employed by the <span class='it'>Active</span> belong
to the north side of Hudson strait and come from the vicinity
of Big island. Several families of these Eskimos are taken on
board the ship when she arrives in the early summer, and remain
on board until she leaves for home in October. These
natives are employed partly in whaling and walrus hunting,
and are very useful in skinning and preparing the hides of the
walrus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At present there is only one American vessel engaged in
whaling on the eastern side of America, the topsail schooner
<span class='it'>Era</span> of New Bedford. This ship entered Hudson bay during
the summer of 1903, wintered in the harbour of Fullerton, and
intended to pass the winter of 1904 in the same harbour,
returning home in the following September. As the <span class='it'>Neptune</span>
wintered alongside at Fullerton, and as the writer made a trip
lasting two weeks to Southampton island, in June, 1904, in
company with four of the whaleboats belonging to the <span class='it'>Era</span>, he
is personally better acquainted with the life and methods of the
American than with those of the Scotch whalers.
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Era</span> is over fifty years old, and was originally built for
a coasting packet. When her usefulness in that trade was
passed, some thirty years ago, she was sheathed with about three
inches of hardwood, and further reinforced with iron plate in
the bow. Little expenditure seems to have since been made by
the owners. The ship is now very leaky, and in such a condition
that she could not get a British rating. During the winter,
when tightly frozen in, the pumps were going daily, and when
at sea they are almost constantly going to keep the vessel afloat,
while the forecastle, the home of a crew of twelve men, has
several inches of water on the floor, and every bunk is soaking
wet. This forecastle is very small, and when the small stove
and table are set up, the men have to crawl over one another to
get to their small double-decked bunks. The air is exceedingly
bad, and these quarters probably account, in part, for the scurvy
prevalent amongst the crew. The food is as antiquated as the
accommodation, and is confined to the staples, barrelled pork
and beef with biscuit left over from the Spanish-American war,
and returned from Cuba more or less alive; to these are added
coffee and molasses of the cheapest kind, and a small quantity
of tinned meats, preserved potatoes and dried apples, none in
quantities sufficient for anything approaching a daily ration;
no antiscorbutics, such as lime-juice, are carried. These antiquated
rations are supplemented by fresh meat of the deer, seal
and walrus obtained from the natives, but during the winter
this supply is often very inadequate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officers and crew numbered twenty on leaving New Bedford.
They consist of the captain, two mates, three boat-steerers,
cook, steward and twelve seamen. None of the officers
hold certificates, and as far as their qualifications to navigate
the ship are concerned, have passed no official test.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The officers and boat-steerers are ‘old hands,’ having made
previous voyages, either to Hudson bay or to the western whaling.
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>
The crew are all landsmen without any knowledge of the
sea, and are obtained for the voyage through the agency of
crimps. Some were signed on under false statements and others
put on board while drunk. In some cases the ship’s articles
were signed after the vessel was at sea, and the majority of the
men when they signed had not had the articles read to them.
Advances made by the crimps at extravagant rates are paid by
the owners without the knowledge or consent of the crew as
soon as the vessel leaves port. No wages are paid, all being on
shares; and the share of the crew is so small and the advance
account and articles supplied from the ‘slop-chest’ so great that
it is the usual thing for each man to find himself in debt to the
owners on his return from no matter how successful a voyage.
None of these practices are allowed on board the British vessel,
and the crew are not only paid monthly wages, but participate
in the profits of the voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>Era’s</span> crew was composed of a gunsmith, a clerk in a
wholesale drug business, an iron moulder, a mechanic, an ex-soldier,
a railway brakesman, an Armenian and several nondescripts
‘about town.’ Of the entire lot only one had ever
been to sea before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The treatment of the crew by the officers was as good as circumstances
permitted, and was in strong contrast to their
general treatment by the owners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The methods of the American whalers differ considerably
from those already described. When the ship arrives in the
northwestern part of the bay, the Aivillik Eskimos are looked
for somewhere in the vicinity of Whale point, and enough men,
practically half of the tribe, are engaged for the time the ship
remains in the bay. The ship’s crew are sufficient to man three
whaleboats, and three others are manned by the natives. Four
boats are brought on the ship every voyage, and only two are
taken home, the other two, equipped for whaling, being left with
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>
the natives, and any whales caught during the ship’s absence
are supposed to belong to the ship furnishing the boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natives and their families and dogs are taken on board
the schooner and conveyed to the harbour where it is proposed
to spend the winter. About seventy persons of this tribe were
at Fullerton during the winter of 1903-04, and twice a day
received a meal of biscuit and coffee on the ship. These people
were fed in the cabin after the officers, and two or three extra
tables were required to accommodate all, so that the meal continued
for nearly two hours, and the atmosphere of the cabin
was anything but sweet. No regular wages are paid to the
natives either during the winter when hunting, or when in the
boats in the summer, but they are given such articles as the captain
thinks they should have or deserve, everything being left
to his judgment or caprice. On the whole they are fairly well
treated, and although they only get a very small percentage of
their catch, still the presence of the whaler ensures them from
starvation, and provides them with boats, guns and ammunition,
all of which would otherwise be difficult or impossible to obtain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While with the ship the entire hunt of the natives is supposed
to belong to the ship, and no definite payment is made for
whales or fur taken during that period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During past years a goodly number of boats have been left to
the natives by the American whalers, and at the present time
the Eskimos scattered from Chesterfield inlet to Repulse bay
must have upwards of twenty serviceable boats. The Aivilliks
have for so long become possessed of boats in this manner, that
they have lost the art of building kyaks, and none of the
younger men know anything about handling these craft.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very little use is made of the ship in the catching of whales,
and it usually only serves as a convenient base of supply, or as
a means of transport from one locality to another.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/268a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_268' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Whaleboats on the Ice, in Roes Welcome.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As the crews live during the greater part of the open season
in the boats, these are fitted with cotton covers supported on
hoops, and are thus completely roofed in, affording very comfortable
if somewhat cramped quarters. Cooking is done with
oil stoves, and sleeping is arranged for by placing wide boards
across the intervals between seats. The boats leave the ship
early in May, long before the ice along the coast begins to break
up, and they cruise up and down along the edge of the solid
land-floe looking for whales. During stormy weather, and at
night, the boats are drawn out on the smooth ice, props are
placed on each side to keep them upright, and the cover being
drawn on and snugly secured, afford secure and comfortable
quarters, provided that the temperature does not drop too low;
in that case, resort is made to the deerskin sleeping bags for
greater warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The west coast of the bay is patrolled in this manner until
about the middle of June, the cruise extending from Chesterfield
inlet to Whale point, supplies being renewed every week
or so. Each of the ship’s boats is in charge of an officer, who
always attends to the steering. The ‘boat-steerers’ are in
reality the harpooners, and have nothing to do with the steering
of the boat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards the end of June the boats cross through the floating
ice to Southampton island, where they remain until compelled
to return for fresh supplies, usually about three weeks. A
second trip to that island is sometimes made, and in August the
ship, now free from the ice, is taken to Repulse bay or the
Frozen strait connecting it with Fox channel. The ship is
again left in harbour under the charge of the cook and steward,
and the boats cruise about until the beginning of September,
when the ship is taken to winter quarters or sails for home. If
the intention is to remain all winter, the harbour is reached
before the middle of the month.
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the routine, and it is only varied by the capture of a
whale. As will be seen from the above description, the boats
cruise nearly all the time in the in-shore waters, and the greater
number of whales are taken within the three-mile limit, and not
on the high seas as is the rule in Baffin bay. If the whale is
killed within reasonable distance of the ship, it is either towed
alongside by the boats, or the ship comes for it, and an endeavour
is made to get the body into a safe harbour in order to save
the blubber. A number of whales are killed in inconvenient
places, and only the bone is then taken, all the blubber going to
waste. When the blubber is taken, it is immediately cut up and
‘tried out’ into oil on board the ship, a large boiler being
carried for that purpose. The hold of the schooner is filled with
large casks, made in different sizes to fit the shape of the hold.
On the outward voyage these are partly filled with the provisions;
returning, they carry the oil and furs collected on the
voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the long winter a part of the natives remain at the
ship, and are employed hunting seals, walrus, and deer to help
feed the women and children and the crew of the ship. The
remainder are sent away after musk-ox, and remain away
several months, having to go a long distance before reaching
the country where those animals are found. A successful party
will return with at least twenty musk-ox skins, and these add
to the profits of the voyage. Stranger Eskimos also visit the
ship to trade, and in this manner a considerable number of
musk-ox, fox, wolf, bear and wolverine skins are added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unlike the Scotch whalers, where the captain remains on
board ship to direct the movements of the boats from the barrel,
the American captain goes in charge of one of the boats. This
works well in open water, but when the whale is among loose
ice very little can be seen from the boats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Americans make use of a hand harpoon, and as it is very
heavy and has a gun attached to it, the boat must approach
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>
within a few feet of the whale before it can be thrown with any
certainty of success; otherwise the manner of capture is similar
to that already described.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/270a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_270' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Scottish Whaling Station at Blacklead Island.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Station whaling, which is very similar to that practised by
the American ships, is carried on both in Baffin bay and Hudson
bay. The stations are either permanent establishments on
land, or are small ships that remain constantly in the country,
and serve only as a convenient dwelling for the small number of
whites with each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the present time land stations are operated at Kekerten
and Blacklead, in Cumberland gulf and at Cape Haven, all on
the east side of Davis strait. At the mouth of Ponds inlet in
Baffin bay a small ketch is stationed; in Repulse bay a similar
vessel is used as a whaling station. With the exception of Cape
Haven these are owned in Scotland, the Cape Haven station
belonging to a firm in Boston, U.S.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only one or two white men are employed at each, and the
whaling is altogether in the hands of the natives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of these stations are making great profits, and some of
them are being maintained at a loss. They are of great assistance
to the natives, and it is to be hoped that nothing will be
done to discourage the owners, who according to present returns
should be helped rather than hindered in their work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The natives have for years looked for assistance to the
whalers both on Baffin island and Hudson bay. They have quite
given up the use of their primitive weapons, and there is no
doubt that a withdrawal of the whalers would lead to great
hardship and many deaths among these people if the Government
did not in some manner take their place and supply the
Eskimos with the necessary guns and ammunition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The influence of the whalers upon the natives does not appear
to have been as bad as in the western part of the Arctics. The
excessive use of alcohol has never been practised, and has now
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
been totally stopped. Disease due to sexual intercourse has
been introduced and has, no doubt, led to many deaths. Other
diseases introduced have carried away numbers of these people.
It is doubtful if the morals of the Eskimo, which are of a different
standard from those of Europeans, have deteriorated
through sexual intercourse with the sailors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The future of the whaling industry appears to be very
gloomy. The annual catch is decreasing regularly, and only the
high price of whalebone makes it at all profitable. No certainty
of a single whale can be had, and the enterprise is reduced to
almost a gambling chance. During the past season the following
returns were collected from the various ships and stations
visited:—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Era.</span>—One small whale taken at Southampton up to the 20th
July. To this must be added the bone of a large and small
whale taken by natives before the <span class='it'>Era’s</span> arrival in 1903.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Balaena.</span>—One medium whale, three-quarters of a ton of
whalebone, to 23rd August.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Diana.</span>—Three whales, two and a quarter tons of whalebone
to 23rd August.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Eclipse.</span>—Two whales, one and a half tons of whalebone, to
23rd August.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Windward.</span>—One whale, three-quarters of a ton of whalebone,
to 23rd August.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ponds inlet station.—Two small whales, a quarter of a ton of
short whalebone, to 23rd August.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kekerten station.—No whales to 1st September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Blacklead station.—No whales to 1st September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cape Haven station.—No whales to 1st September.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Active.</span>—One whale, 1,300 pounds bone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Repulse bay station.—One small whale, 500 pounds bone.
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Several other species of the larger whales are known to frequent
the southern and eastern waters of Davis strait and Baffin
bay, but do not go into the densely ice-covered seas of the western
side, nor are they found in Hudson strait or bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>None of these whales possess the precious whalebone. They
are also of comparatively little value for oil, and only when
hunted by steamers in conjunction with shore factories, where
all the products can be turned to profitable account, as is done
in Norway and Newfoundland, can the chase for them be profitable.
Such ships and stations will require to be operated from
the Greenland coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following species of whales are the most common and
important:—</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Physalus antiquorum</span>, Flem.—Big Finner, is found in Davis
strait, chiefly on the cod-banks, where it devours immense numbers
of fish. For its size it gives a remarkably small quantity
of oil. On this account it is not killed by the whalers, and
seldom by the natives.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Balaenoptera sibbaldii.</span> Gray.—This whale is usually confounded
with the one last mentioned; has the same range and
habits, and is rarely killed by the natives.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Balaenoptera rostrata</span>, Fab.—The Little Finner has the same
range as the above, being well known to the Eskimos of Greenland
and unknown to those of Baffin island.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Megaptera longimana</span>, Gray.—The Humpback, appears on
the Greenland coast in summer. Its whalebone is very short
and of a poor quality, so that its price in no way compares with
that of the Right whale. The blubber also is poor and makes
little oil in comparison to its size.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Orca gladiator</span>, Sund.—The Killer (Grampus, or Swordfish),
is very voracious, and lives largely upon fish, seals, porpoises
and white whales. It also attacks large Right whales, and on
<span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>
this account is disliked by the whalers, as the presence of a
single Killer means the immediate flight of all creatures in that
vicinity. Luckily it will not penetrate among the heavy floes,
where the Right whales retreat for safety. Some idea of the
destruction to life caused by the Killer may be formed from the
fact that in the stomach of one were found fourteen porpoises
and fourteen large seals; it choked to death swallowing the
fifteenth. They chase seals and White whales on shore, and the
seals are often seen jumping clear out of water in their endeavour
to escape.</p>

<h2>PORPOISES.</h2>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Phocaena communis</span>, Brookes.—The porpoise arrives on the
Greenland coast early in the spring, but does not go north of
latitude 69° N., nor does it frequent the ice-laden seas of Baffin
bay; it is unknown in Hudson strait and bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Beluga catadon</span>, Gray.—The White whale or White porpoise
(Kellulauak, Eskimo) is common to all the Arctic coasts, and
remains throughout the year. It usually travels in large schools,
frequenting the bays and mouths of rivers. In the north large
numbers have been taken by the whalers along the coast of
North Somerset, both in Prince Regent inlet and in Barrow
strait. It is plentiful in the rivers at the heads of Cumberland
gulf and Frobisher bay. Many are killed annually by the
natives along the south shore of Hudson strait. The Hudson’s
Bay Company has for several years past made successful fisheries
in the mouth of the Koksoak river and in Leaf bay, both
in the southwest part of Ungava bay. Similar fisheries were
formerly conducted in the mouths of Great and Little Whale
rivers on the east side of Hudson bay, but after some success
the whales would not enter these rivers over the nets, and the
fisheries were abandoned. The writer has seen great numbers
of White whales in the mouths of the rivers to the northward of
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>
Little Whale river, notably so in that of the Nastapoka.
The Eskimos depend upon the White whale for part of their
food and lamp oil. The meat is coarse and dark, being, like
that of the seals, highly charged with blood and having a fishy
flavour. The boiled skin is a native dainty, and is in the same
class as beaver-tail or moose nose, soft and gelatinous. There is
little doubt that, with the opening of Hudson bay, the White
whale fishery will become an important industry in many places
in the bay and strait, and also along the coast to the northward.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Monodon monoceras</span>, Linn.—The Narwhal has habits very
similar to those of the White whale. It generally travels in
bands, and appears to prefer the proximity of ice, so that its
summer range is more northern than that of the White whale.
The Baffin bay whalers obtain a considerable number of narwhal
horns from the natives of north Greenland, the best place
being in the vicinity of Cape York, or to the eastward of Melville
bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narwhal appears to replace the White whale in the waters
of Ponds inlet, only the former being killed there. Numbers are
taken in the ice by the whalers of Baffin bay; they are not uncommon
about Cumberland gulf when the ice still covers its
waters. The natives of Hudson strait kill numbers of these
animals in the early summer, and after the shore-ice has formed
in the early winter, but none are seen on the south shore during
the open waters of summer. The narwhal is only found in the
northern waters of Hudson bay, where it is abundant in the
ice-laden waters of Fox channel and Frozen strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The narwhal is distinguished in the water from the White
whale by its darker colour, its white spots and its horn. The
colour becomes lighter with age, so that very old individuals
become dirty white. According to the Eskimos, the horn is
confined to the males, and its chief use is for domestic battle.
Only one horn is usually developed, growing out of the upper
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>
jaw, and projecting directly forward. A second horn on the
other side of the jaw is not uncommon, but it is always shorter,
and is often malformed or rudimentary. The horns vary in
length up to eight feet, and are composed of a very fine quality
of ivory. At the base the average thickness is from two to three
inches; it tapers gradually to a point, having a spiral twist
throughout the length. There is a large pith core at the base,
which gradually fills after the horn has reached maturity, so
that in old animals the horn is almost completely solid. This
ivory is much more valuable than that obtained from the tusks
of the walrus, being worth from $2.50 to $3 a pound. The
ultimate destination of the ivory is China, where it is used for
ornamental purposes as well as for medicine, and for the manufacture
of cups supposed to absorb all poisons placed in them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flesh and skin of the narwhal are put to the same uses

<p class='pindent'>The information to 1866 has been taken from the narrative of C. F. Hall’s second

<h2>SEALS.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>There exists at present considerable confusion in the number
of species and the classification of the northern seals. A scientific
argument on classification is beyond the province of this
report, and it need only be mentioned that, after careful
inquiry from the Eskimos of Baffin island and Hudson bay,
there is no doubt that, including the walrus, there are but six
species of seals in the northern seas of eastern America, and
that the other species named are simply due to varieties of age,
size and colour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The present account is confined to the distribution, habits
and uses of these animals.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Callocephalus vitulinus</span>, Linn.—The Harbour seal, Freshwater
seal, or Ranger (Kassigiak, Eskimo), is common but not
plentiful on all the coasts. It is found usually about the mouths
of rivers, and in bays and fiords. It is also found in some of the
larger lakes of Labrador and Baffin island. These lakes are often
far inland and high above the present level of the sea, and
there is no doubt that in a number of them the seals reside
permanently. The young, unlike those of the other seals, are
produced in July on the rocks about the banks of rivers.
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The skins are prized by the natives owing to their fur-like
character and beauty of colour. They are dressed with the hair
on, and are chiefly used for women’s garments, fancy bags and
for the boot-legs of dandies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flesh and blubber, especially of the older and larger
freshwater seals, have a disagreeable odour and taste, and consequently
are not so highly prized by the natives as are those of
the following species.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Pagomys foetidus</span>, Fab.—The Ringed seal, or Jar (Nietshik,
Eskimo), is the common small seal of all the coasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The variations in size, markings and colour, due to age, have
led to this seal being classed under several species.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Its flesh is the chief article of diet of the natives the year
round, while its skin when dressed with the hair is used for
clothing, tentings and bags; when dressed by removing the hair,
it is used as covering for the kyak and for boot-legs. The
blubber, burned in stone lamps, is the chief source of artificial
heat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young are born in March in snow-houses scraped out by
the female from a snow-bank, close to an air-hole on the ice.
When born they have a glistening white coat of soft hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Pagophilus groenlandicus</span>, Mull.—The Harp seal, Saddle-back,
Bedlamiers, (Kirolik, Eskimo,) supplies fully two-thirds
of the seals taken annually off the coasts of Newfoundland in
the spring, when the females give birth to their young on the
floating ice of the Arctic pack. The Harp seal is more or less
common on the northern coasts, and southward along the
Atlantic coast of Labrador, at all seasons. In Hudson strait
they are rare in summer, but are not uncommon after the shore-ice
forms in the autumn, and before it leaves in the early
summer. These seals commonly travel in bands, and are known
by their habit of frequently leaping from the water. They are
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>
rare in Hudson bay, especially during the summer season, and
are only occasionally seen at other times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The flesh and blubber are used by the natives for food and
fuel. The skins are used mostly for tentings and boot-legs, and
where the skin of the Ground seal is not available for boot-bottoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Phoco barbata,</span> Fab.—The Bearded seal, Big seal, Ground
seal, Square-flipper, (Oujuk, Eskimo,) is common on all the
coasts, and is the most abundant seal at Cape Haven, and Cape
Chidley on the eastern coast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It brings forth its young, which are born near an opening in
the shore-ice, about a month later than the Ringed seal. This
seal is next in size to the walrus, and its capture always brings
gladness to the Eskimos, providing, as it does, a large amount of
meat and blubber, while from its hide is cut an exceedingly
strong line used for dog-traces and other purposes. The dressed
skin is used for the soles of boots, for covering kyaks and
women’s boats, for tentings, and many other purposes. The flesh
is coarser in texture, but less fishy in flavour, than that of the
smaller seals. The liver is said to be somewhat poisonous, and
is not often eaten.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Cystophera cristata</span>, Erxl.—-The Hooded seal, or Bladder-nose,
(Nietshivok, Eskimo,) is a large and ferocious seal,
second in size only to the Big seal. It produces its young about
two weeks later than the Harps, and usually on ice farther off
the coast. These seals make up the remainder of the catch of
the Newfoundland sealers. In the summer they are common at
Ponds inlet, and become rarer along the coasts to the southward.
The Hooded seal is unknown to the natives of Hudson bay, and
is an exceedingly rare visitor in Hudson strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Trichechus rosmarus</span>, Linn.—The walrus, (Aivik, Eskimo,)
is found in all the northern waters, where it appears to prefer
the presence of floating ice, and rarely or never comes out on the
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>
shore-ice. During the past voyage of the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> many walrus
were seen; the most northern locality was at the entrance to
Smith sound, where large numbers were congregated on pans of
floating ice, between Etah and Cape Sabine. Numbers were
seen along the coast of Ellesmere island and in the waters of
Lancaster sound. The whalers and natives report them as very
plentiful in Wellington channel. They are common along the
coast of Baffin island, a considerable number being killed annually
at the station at Cape Haven, and in Cumberland gulf.
They are very numerous in Fox channel and Frozen strait,
where they are captured while on the floating ice usually found
in these localities throughout the summer. When the ice leaves
Hudson bay and Hudson strait, the walrus resort to favourite
localities, usually small rocky islands, where they are frequently
found in large numbers. Such islands are located in King
sound, near Douglas harbour, on the south side of the strait; at
the west end of Charles island, also in the strait; at Walrus
island in Fisher strait, and at several small islands of the
Belcher and other outer islands of the east coast of Hudson bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the St. Lawrence was discovered the walrus was found
as far south as the Magdalen islands, and, within a comparatively
recent time, they were common on the Atlantic coast of
Labrador; now they are only killed rarely at Cape Chidley, the
northern point of that coast. On Hudson bay they were
formerly found as far south as Paint islands on the east
side of James bay, but now they do not frequent that coast
south of latitude 60° N., and their southern limit is about latitude
57° N., on the Belcher islands. There has been a rapid
diminution in the number of walrus in the northern part of the
bay during the past few years, since the <span class='it'>Active</span> has been
engaged in their capture, and it is only a question of a few
years, if the present methods of killing are continued, before
the walrus will become as rare as the Right whale in the waters
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
of Hudson bay. It is acknowledged that, with present methods
of capture and the difficulties of the chase, only one in four or
five of the animals killed is eventually secured. The walrus
is necessary for the subsistence of the northern Eskimo and his
dogs. The flesh is strong and sustaining, the blubber is abundant
and good, while the tusks are of great use for shoeing sleds
and the manufacture of spears and harpoons, and other hunting
and domestic gear. The present value of the walrus to civilization
is small. Oil is made from the blubber, and the skins are
used chiefly for ‘buffing’ metal goods. The ivory of the tusks
is inferior, and only worth about fifty cents a pound. The
present price for hides is from eight to ten cents a pound, and
consequently the entire products of a large walrus is under fifty
dollars in value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking into consideration the value of the animal to the
native, the great waste of life in the killing, and the comparative
small value to civilization, it might be well to pass regulations
reserving this animal wholly for the use of the Eskimos.</p>

<div><h1 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XI.<br/> <span class='sub-head'>NAVIGATION OF HUDSON BAY.</span></h1></div>

<p class='pindent'>The question of the navigation of Hudson bay and Hudson
strait has been before the Canadian public for a period extending
back almost to the time of Confederation. An answer to
this question has become more and more pressing, as the latent
wealth of the grain-fields of the Northwest has been proved, and
as the present means of transport of this great volume of grain
to the eastward become yearly less capable of handling it expeditiously
and cheaply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the past few years the yield of Northwest grain
has increased enormously, and a second line of rails is being
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>
laid across the continent to aid in the rapid transport of this
wealth to the seaboard. If the increase in the area of land
opened annually to cultivation continues as at present, a few
years will show such a volume of grain to be transported that
the new outlets will be unable to give free exit to it, and a new
lane by which it can be taken to the European markets must be
found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The route by rail to the port of Churchill, on the western side
of Hudson bay, and from thence to Europe in ships, is the
shortest, and is likely to prove the best, of all those outside the
present routes by rail to the headwaters of the St. Lawrence
navigation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ships go wherever cargoes can be obtained, and all that is
needed to open Hudson bay for ordinary commercial navigation
is a line of rails to carry freight to one of its ports. At present
the Hudson’s Bay Company and the Revillon Fur Company
have ships going annually to the bay, and a greater amount of
freight would attract more steamers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As stated in the historical summary, the London merchants
opened communication with northern Russia by ships trading
in the White sea in the days of Queen Elizabeth. Spurred on
by the success attending this adventure to the northeast, a few
years later they sent vessels to the northwest, in the hopes of
opening up a similar trade, and of discovering a short and safe
passage to the rich markets of China and India.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hudson’s voyage in 1610 resulted in the discovery of Hudson
bay, and in the knowledge that no great opportunities existed
there for extensive commerce, owing to the lack of civilized
natives. James and Fox completed the exploration of the bay,
without coming in contact with any of the natives residing on
its shores.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The formation of the Hudson’s Bay Company was due to the
knowledge of the French fur traders, that a profitable trade
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>
might be carried on with the natives frequenting the shores of
the bay. This trade from its nature never required a large fleet
of ships in its carrying trade, but since 1668 the company have
sent annually one or more ships to supply its posts, and to bring
back the valuable furs obtained from the inhabitants; and it is
remarkable that with the imperfect charts of its waters so few
ships have been lost in the last two hundred and fifty years;
of these only a small number have met with disaster from
contact with the ice in the bay or strait. From the time of the
Treaty of Utrecht to the transfer of the lands of the Hudson’s
Bay Company to the Dominion, the bay and strait were a closed
sea belonging exclusively to the Company, and other ships
entered these waters unlawfully, and navigation by outsiders
was practically prohibited there. The American whalers visited
the northern portions of the bay as early as 1860, and within
a few years their number had increased to fourteen ships wintering
in its northern waters. As these vessels did not directly
interfere with the fur trade they were left undisturbed, and are
only mentioned here to show that other ships besides those of
the Hudson’s Bay Company have for a considerable period been
navigating the bay, but being intent upon a paying enterprise
did not herald their achievements to the public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Dominion Government, in 1885-86, sent out steamers
under Commander Gordon to test the period of navigation of
Hudson strait, and at the same time established observation
stations along the length of the strait, where the action of the
ice was studied during these two years. Commander Gordon
reported that the strait was open for three or four months for
navigation by specially constructed ships. In 1897 a second
expedition was sent out under the charge of Commander
Wakeham, who was accompanied by Mr. Fisher, a representative
of the Manitoba government. Both reported on the navigation
of the strait and bay, and practically upheld all the
statements of Commander Gordon.
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I was attached to the second expedition as a geologist, and
performed some exploring duties on the southern coast of the
strait in the late summer, having been on board the ship during
her first passage through the strait. This experience in the
navigation of these waters was further increased by a passage
westward through the strait during the following summer in
the Hudson’s Bay Company’s steamer <span class='it'>Erik</span>, and still further
by the four trips of the past voyage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hudson strait has a length of nearly five hundred miles from
Cape Chidley, on the south side of its eastern end, to Cape Wolstenholme
on the same side of its western end. The general
trend of the strait is a little north of west, so that the western
cape is about a degree and a half to the northward of the eastern
one, and is in 62° 30´ N. latitude. At its eastern entrance the
strait has a practical channel nearly thirty-five miles wide
between the outermost Button island off Cape Chidley, and the
shores of Resolution island on the north side. Gray strait is a
narrower channel between the Button islands and the southern
mainland. Immediately to the westward of Cape Chidley the
southern shore falls away to the southward to form the great
bay of Ungava, which is one hundred and forty miles wide, and
somewhat more than that distance in length. The large island
of Akpatok lies in this bay, but as its north end is to the southward
of a line drawn across the mouth of the bay, it does not
seriously interfere with navigation in the strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From Cape Hopes Advance, the western point of Ungava
bay, the southern shore of the strait has a northwest direction
to Cape Weggs, situated one hundred and fifty miles beyond.
The northern shore opposite has the same general trend, and
the strait for this distance averages sixty miles across. Big
island, situated on the north side in the western half of this
portion, extends southward, so as to reduce the width to thirty
miles.
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To the westward of Cape Weggs the general trend of the
south coast is nearly due west, while the opposite side continues
northwest to form Gordon bay, after which it bends to the west
and south, so that at its western end the strait is about one
hundred miles from mainland to mainland, but of this distance
the practical channel is limited to that portion between the
south coast and the large island of Nottingham, a distance of
thirty-five miles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the western half of the strait, Charles island, which lies
about twenty-five miles beyond Cape Weggs, is the only obstruction
to navigation. This island is twenty-five miles long, and
lies nearly due east-and-west, some twenty miles from the south
shore of the strait. The ship channel passes to the northward
of the island, although there is a good channel on its south side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The depth of water in the ship track through the strait varies
from fifty to two hundred fathoms. There are no shoals, and
with ordinary precautions, there is little danger from stranding
on the bold shores of either side of the strait, or on the few
islands that bound the channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of safe harbours easy of approach have been explored
on the southern side of the strait, and others equally
good and safe are known to be located on the north side,
although they are at present unsurveyed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The passage from the western entrance of the strait to the
port of Churchill, on the western side of Hudson bay, is five
hundred miles. From the mouth of the strait the course is due
west for seventy miles to the eastern end of the wide channel
between Coats and Mansfield islands. This channel is practically
one hundred miles long, and varies in width from fifty
miles at the eastern end, to over a hundred at the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The general course of the ship track from the eastern end of
this channel to Churchill is nearly southwest, and there are nowhere
any dangerous shoals or other obstructions to navigation.
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the track across Hudson bay the depth of water varies
from fifty to two hundred fathoms, while the approach to the
low shores of Coats and Mansfield and those of the western
mainland is signalled by the gradual lessening of the depth of
water, which gives ample warning to ships approaching the land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It will be seen from the above description that there is no
natural difficulty in the navigation of the bay and strait so far
as the depth of water, presence of obstructions and width of
channel are concerned, and if situated in a more southern
region the route would be an ideal one for the navigator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The western coast of Hudson bay is low and flat. It rises
very slowly inland from swampy shores, while the water
deepens slowly, and there are numerous shoals and bars that
extend for a considerable distance from the shore-line and
render coastwise navigation dangerous. This character of coast
extends from the southern end of James bay to beyond the
mouth of Churchill harbour. Further north the character of
the coast changes somewhat, being still low, but much more
uneven in outline, with a corresponding unevenness in the sea-bottom.
Beyond Eskimo point, in 61° N. latitude, the straight
shores of the southward give place to a ragged coast-line broken
by large bays, and fringed with rocky islands having shallow
water between them, and a broken bottom very dangerous to
navigation. On this account, and because of the danger from
outlying shoals and strong currents, the navigation of Chesterfield
inlet and that of the other northern bays and harbours is
debarred from consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mouths of all the large rivers to the southward of
Churchill are more or less blocked by deposits of sand and clay
brought down by the streams and deposited in the quieter waters
at their mouths in the form of bars or flat shoals. In consequence
of these obstructions, only small craft can enter the
harbours inside the mouths of these rivers, and larger ships are
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>
obliged to lay in the dangerous roadsteads usually several miles
away from the nearest dry land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The approach to the harbour of Churchill, if aided by a few
beacons and lights, would be comparatively safe, as the channel
of approach is fairly deep and wide. Once inside the points of
the mouth, the harbour extends up stream about a mile, and has
an average width of half a mile, with a couple of shallow places
in the upper part that might easily be removed by dredging;
the general depth of the harbour being from four to four and a
half fathoms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some knowledge of the currents is desirable in discussing the
navigability of Hudson strait and Hudson bay, for on them
depend largely the character and amount of ice met with in
these northern waters. Observations on the drift of the ice
that covers the Arctic seas point to a general law governing
the currents. This law, briefly stated, is, that no matter what
the size, shape or direction of one of these northern bodies of
water may be, the direction of flow of the current will be such
that one facing with it will have the land on the right hand.
This may be differently stated by saying that with bodies of
water having a general north-and-south trend, the current will
flow north on the east side and south on the west, while in east-and-west
bodies the direction of flow will be west on the north
side and east on the south side. This law has been found to
apply to the waters of Hudson strait and Hudson bay as well
as to those of the more northern bays and straits visited on the
<span class='it'>Neptune</span>. The mere statement of this law is made here, as the
discussion of the causes producing it, be they due to the earth’s
motion or wind action, is outside the province of this report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The current from the eastward along the northern side of
Hudson strait was known to the early navigators of those
waters, who took advantage of it when passing through the
strait from the Atlantic. The presence of icebergs in the northern
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
waters of the strait can only be accounted for by this
current, for they must all come from Davis strait, there being
no glaciers to produce them on the lands fronting on the strait
or bay. These icebergs have been seen as far west as the western
end of Salisbury island, almost to the entrance of Hudson bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The east-flowing current of the south side of the strait was
proved by the drift of the <span class='it'>Neptune</span> when beset in the ice off
Cape Wolstenholme, and later, off Cape Weggs. In the former
instance the drift of the ship was thirty miles in twenty-four
hours, while in the latter it was twenty miles in twenty hours.
Driftwood borne north on the current of the east side of Hudson
bay is not rare on the southern shores of the western part of
the strait, while large quantities of it are found on the eastern
shores of Ungava bay, having been drifted east and north from
the mouths of the rivers emptying into the head of that bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The current flowing westward along the north side of the
strait sweeps northward up the east side of Fox channel, rounds
the head of that large northern bay, and then flows southward
along the east side of Southampton, bringing with it the heavy
ice from the northern parts of Fox channel, so that heavy drift
ice is almost always found to the north of the eastern entrance
to Evans strait, and often comes sufficiently south to partly
block the channel between Mansfield and Coats islands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The current from the north along the western shores of Hudson
bay is not important as regards navigation, as it comes from
the narrow waters of Roes Welcome and does not transport a
large quantity of field ice.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/290a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_290' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Rafted Ice in Roes Welcome, June, 1904.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>Similar currents follow the shores of Baffin bay and Davis
strait; on the east, or Greenland side, the flow is northward,
while along the west side or that of the Arctic islands the current
is southward, and carries on its surface great quantities of
heavy field ice formed in these northern waters, together with
extensive masses of Arctic ice which have passed south or east
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>
through the wide sounds connecting the northern parts of Baffin
bay with the Arctic ocean. Many icebergs discharged from the
northern glaciers are also found in this heavy ice of the ‘middle
pack’ of Baffin bay and Davis strait. This Arctic current
closely follows the eastern shores of Baffin island, branches of
it sweeping into Cumberland gulf and Frobisher bay. When it
reaches the latitude of the mouth of Hudson strait, the part
adjacent to the land turns westward through the channel
between Resolution island and the north shore of the strait,
while another stream sweeps westward around the island of
Resolution, where, meeting the current flowing out of the strait,
the strong cross currents, tides and ‘overfalls’ noted by the
earliest navigators are formed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main stream of the Arctic current passes southward
across the mouth of Hudson strait, and forms the northern current
of the Atlantic coast of Labrador. It bears on its surface
the wide stream of ice which in the summer forms the ‘middle
pack’ of Baffin bay, and which later in the year passes the
mouths of Cumberland gulf and Frobisher bay, and in November,
or early in December, closes the eastern entrance to Hudson
strait. At that time a considerable area of this northern ice
may enter the eastern part of the strait, but is prevented from
completely filling the strait by the amount of locally formed ice
already covering its waters. Continuing southward on the
current, this stream of ice, often upwards of fifty miles in
width, blocks the coast of Labrador during the early months of
the year, and by the end of March arrives off the coasts of Newfoundland,
bearing on its surface an immense number of
newly-born seals to make the important seal fishery of Newfoundland.
Part of this ice is carried through the Strait of
Belle Isle into the northern portion of the Gulf of St. Lawrence,
while the greater portion passes south along the east coast of
Newfoundland to Cape Race. Here the western part of the ice
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>
is deflected to the westward along the southern shores of the
island, and finally enters the southern part of the Gulf of St.
Lawrence, while the remainder is soon melted in the warmer
waters of the Atlantic south of Newfoundland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ice commences to form in the smaller bays of the northern
parts of Hudson bay and Hudson strait early in October, and
by the end of that month the northern harbours are frozen over.
The more southern ones, especially those at the mouths of the
larger rivers, do not close until late in November or early in the
following month. By the beginning of January, James bay is
frozen across, and at the same time solid ice usually extends
from the east coast of Hudson bay to the outer line of islands,
some sixty or seventy miles from that coast. In other parts of
Hudson bay, and in Hudson strait a margin of solid ice usually
extends from one to five miles from the shore, except where the
coast is high and bold with deep water close to the base of the
cliffs. In such places, especially at headlands, solid ice does
not form, and the natives in winter often have to make long and
difficult detours inland to pass them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The main body of Hudson bay does not freeze solid, and the
same may be said of Hudson strait. Although this is the case,
these waters are quite unnavigable for ordinary ships during
the winter and spring months owing to the great sheets of heavy
ice borne backwards and forwards by the tides and currents,
and drifted about by the winter gales. There is little doubt
that a specially constructed ship for ice navigation might pass
through Hudson strait at any season, but the voyage would be
a long one, and the difficulties and dangers would be great.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/292a_plate.jpg' alt='' id='illo_292' style='width:100%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'><span class='sc'>Ice in Cumberland Gulf. September, 1904.</span></p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The ice of Hudson bay and the greater part of that of Hudson
strait is of local origin, being formed by the freezing of the
surface of the sea near-by. Observations on the growth in thickness
of the ice were made in Fullerton harbour throughout the
winter of 1903-04, and a record of the weekly observations is
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
given later in the report. These observations show that the
thickness increases steadily until the month of June, when a
maximum of seventy-four inches was measured. The conditions
under which this was obtained were very favourable for the
ice, and only in similarly protected northern harbours does it
attain such a thickness. In the larger bays and along the unprotected
coasts, where the ice freezes later, and is frequently
broken up by gales during the winter, the thickness rarely
exceeds three or four feet. This thinner ice makes up the
greater part of that found in the spring-time covering the
waters of Hudson bay and strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the ice continues to increase until June, winter conditions
continue well into that month, and it is not until its last days
that the heat of the sun is sufficiently strong and sustained to
begin the melting process. With the advent of July this process
is well under way, and the daily change in the condition and
amount of the ice is then marvellous, so much so, that where
everything was fast frozen in the beginning of the month, by
the middle not a vestige of ice remains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If a single thickness of sheet ice covered these northern
waters they would be completely clear early in July, but unfortunately
much of the floating ice is ‘rafted’ or piled up, sheet
on sheet, and the whole cemented solidly together to form large
masses often twenty feet or more in thickness. This rafting is
caused by the pressure formed by large masses of ice driven
together, or against ice attached to the shores, which causes the
ice along the margins to break and buckle, cake on cake. These
pressure areas are often of considerable size, and usually are
many times longer than broad. They serve as a framework to
hold together large fields of single sheet ice. When the thinner
ice melts, these pressure masses remain, and are dangerous to
shipping until the water has become sufficiently warm to melt
the ice cementing the cakes together; then they are harmless,
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>
as the slightest shock causes the mass to fall to pieces with a
great commotion but with little danger. This disintegration is
known as ‘calving.’</p>

<p class='pindent'>The northern ice which occasionally enters Hudson strait in
the early part of the winter as before described, is much more
complicated and much heavier in character than the local ice.
Some of this ice may be met with in the early period of navigation
to the eastward of Big island, and should be treated with
respect. The icebergs included with it often remain until late
in the season, and form a source of danger in foggy weather,
but they are usually so few as to be negligible, especially in the
western half of the strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To summarize the foregoing: Hudson strait and Hudson bay
do not freeze solid, but are so covered with masses of floating
ice as to be practically unnavigable for at least seven months in
the year. The ice does not begin to melt until well into the
month of June, and is not sufficiently melted for safe navigation
with ordinary steamers until the middle of July. No ice is
formed in the strait and bay sufficiently heavy to obstruct
ordinary navigation until the latter part of November, but
towards the close of this period there is danger from the early
passage of the northern pack across the mouth of the strait, and
also, to a much less degree, from the ice from Fox channel
partly closing the western entrance to the strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the temperature of the air falls several degrees below
zero, as it does in November, a thick mist or fog rises from the
open water and renders navigation somewhat dangerous. In
the early part of the season before the ice has completely melted,
fogs are liable to occur in proximity to the ice fields. At other
times fogs are not prevalent, and the weather is ordinarily fair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The worst storms come from the south and east, and these are
usually accompanied by rain in the summer, and by snow later
in the season. Northerly winds bring clear cold weather as a rule.
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The period of safe navigation for ordinary iron steamships
through Hudson strait and across Hudson bay to the port of
Churchill, may be taken to extend from the 20th of July to the
1st of November. This period might be increased without much
risk by a week in the beginning of the season and by perhaps
two weeks at the close.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ships entering Hudson strait from the Atlantic during the
early part of the season, when ice is present in the strait, should
keep in the northern half of the channel between Resolution
and the Button islands. Care should be taken to keep some
miles from Resolution, as the strong currents close to the island
cause the ice to come together and open again with considerable
violence. The north side of the strait should be followed as far
as Big island, keeping at a respectful distance from the land in
order to avoid the pressure when the ice is pressed on the land
by southerly winds. There are frequently large quantities of
ice in the neighbourhood of Big island, with at times considerable
pressure; on this account ships should not approach close to
the island. From Big island the course should be so laid that
the ship may pass a few miles to the northward of Charles
island, and from there the middle channel should be followed to
pass between Nottingham island and Cape Wolstenholme. The
southern side of the channel between Mansfield and Coats is
usually freer of ice than the north side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In passing eastward through Hudson strait, advantage should
be taken of the favourable current on the south side, and that
shore followed to Charles island, where the channel to the south
of the island may be used, taking care to keep well away from
the mainland until Cape Weggs is passed. The southern half
of the centre channel should then be followed to beyond Big
island, when the mid channel across the mouth of Ungava bay
will probably be found clear of ice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fur trade with the Indians and Eskimos living about
Hudson bay or along interior routes tributary to it, has for a
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
period extending over two centuries and a half furnished
cargoes for two or more ships belonging to the Hudson’s Bay
Company. At the present time two ships are engaged in this
trade for the Company, while Revillon Bros. employ two more.
The whale fishery now supports two ships. These four ships
represent the developed trade of the bay and strait at the
present time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The undeveloped natural resources of the regions surrounding
these waters appertain to mining and fisheries, and to the
forestry of the territory surrounding the rivers flowing into
the southern parts of the bay. Iron ores have been found
on the islands and shores of the eastern side of Hudson bay,
where they cover large areas and where valuable deposits
corresponding to those of the hard ores of Lake Superior will
be discovered when sought for. On the western shores of the
bay between Chesterfield inlet and Churchill, extensive deposits
of copper-bearing rocks have been located, and there is every
prospect of valuable mines being discovered in that region when
the ground has been properly prospected. A valuable mica
mine is being worked at a profit on the north shore of Hudson
strait, and the condition and character of the rocks there point
to the discovery of similar deposits on that side of the strait.
Iron ores are known to occur along the west side of Ungava bay,
and the rocks of the southern side of the strait in many places
are favourable to the occurrence of valuable minerals. The
greater part of the coastal region has only been geologically
examined in a hurried manner, while large stretches are practically
unknown inland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing is at present known of the fisheries of the deeper
waters of the strait and bay, and the knowledge of the fisheries
of these waters is confined to the coasts and rivers. In the
southern part of the bay, large quantities of sea-run trout and
whitefish are taken by the natives. The Arctic salmon, a fish
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>
superior to the best Pacific salmon, is plentiful along the eastern
side of the bay to the northward of James bay, as well as in the
mouths of the rivers of the northern and northwest coasts, and
also along both shores of the strait. Lake trout is a common
fish in these northern rivers and lakes. Cod have been taken in
several places along the east side of Hudson bay as far north as
Cape Smith; on the western side little is known of this fish
beyond the occurrence of a few in Roes Welcome, and some
small specimens taken among the ice at Fullerton. A cod
fishery has been carried on for a number of years at Cape
Chidley, and these fish are said to be plentiful along the east
side of Ungava bay, but do not appear to go farther westward
through the strait from the Atlantic. Cod are reported to be
abundant in some of the fiords of the south side of Frobisher bay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The forestry of the southern rivers is outside the scope of
this report, and it need only be mentioned that large areas of
pulpwood and merchantable spruce occur along the banks of
these streams, awaiting a suitable outlet to market by way of
Hudson bay and strait.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These undeveloped resources of the north will no doubt when
developed add greatly to the annual shipping of Hudson bay,
but the main increase to the fleet will be due to the products of
the great plains of the Northwest, now rapidly filling with
robust settlers. These products of the western farms, grain,
butter, and cattle, will naturally seek the shortest road to the
European markets; a road not only shorter, but owing to its
cool climate, capable of landing perishable products and grain
in a better condition than the more southern routes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking Regina as a convenient centre for these northwestern
farming lands, the distance from there by way of Prince Albert
to Churchill is about 800 miles, or the same distance as from
Regina to Fort William on Lake Superior, and a thousand miles
shorter than the distance from Regina to Montreal at the head
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>
of sea navigation on the St. Lawrence. The distance from
Churchill to Liverpool is almost the same as that from Montreal
to Liverpool; consequently there is a saving in distance of a
thousand miles of rail or river carriage in favour of the
northern route.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question of the storage of the grain until the season following
the harvest, is at first sight a serious one, but when it is
known that not twenty per cent of the grain at present reaches
the seaboard before the opening of navigation of the year
following that in which it is harvested, this objection practically
disappears, for the grain may be as well stored on the shores of
Hudson bay as in the elevators on the plains, or at Fort William.
The question of storage is reduced to the length of time between
the opening of navigation of Hudson strait, and the time
required to transport grain from Fort William to Montreal
after the opening of navigation on the great lakes, and this
difference in time may be measured by days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The country through which a railway must run to reach the
port of Churchill is known to offer no serious difficulties, and
although the local freights between the bay and the head of Lake
Winnipeg may be small, the district traversed is equal in fertility
and natural resources to much of that through which the
Canadian Pacific Railway runs to the northward of the great
lakes. Given a good harbour, such as that of Churchill, and an
adequate number of tramp steamships, there will be no difficulty
in removing from that port during the season of safe
navigation all the grain and other supplies that can be drawn
there by a single line of rails.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The object of this article on the navigation of Hudson strait
and Hudson bay is to point out the period of safe navigation,
and the advantages and drawbacks of this route to Europe;
other problems of transportation and usefulness being left to
those in a better position to judge and pronounce upon them.</p>

<h3>BEECHEY ISLAND, LANCASTER SOUND.</h3>

<div class='summary'>
<p class='pindent'><span class='it'>Acervularia austini</span> (Salter). 1852. Sutherland’s voyage<a id='r1_3'/><a href='#f1_3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>*</span></sup></a>, appendix,
p. ccxxx, Strephodes? Austini, pl. 6, figs. 6, 6a.</p>
</div>

<p class='pindent'>The type specimens of this species were obtained at Cornwallis,
Beechey and Griffiths islands. A number of corals in Mr. Low’s collection,
from Beechey island, appear to belong to this species, judging
from Salter’s description and figures and those of Houghton in the
Journal of the Royal Dublin Society, vol. 1, 1856-57 (1858), p. 246,
pl. X., figs. 2, 2a.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In Mr. Low’s specimens the inner structure is fairly well shown.
The larger septa pass to the centre of the corallites where they are
slightly twisted, and together with the arched, rather vesicular tabulæ,
form a definite central area that appears at the bottom of the cups
as a more or less distinct boss. The septa (averaging from thirty to
forty in number) bear arched carinæ on their sides. The corallites
are slightly larger than those of <span class='it'>A. gracilis</span><a id='r2_3'/><a href='#f2_3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>†</span></sup></a> (Billings), from Grand
Manitoulin island, Lake Huron (Niagara group), otherwise the specimens
could with equal propriety be referred to the Lake Huron species.
The size of the corallites varies in <span class='it'>A. austini</span> from about 3 to 8
mm. in diameter, in Mr. Low’s specimens up to about 10 mm. across,
but in <span class='it'>A. gracilis</span> the corallites seldom reach a diameter of 7 mm. If
by a direct comparison it is found that Mr. Low’s specimens are without
doubt properly referable to <span class='it'>A. austini</span>, and if it can be shown that
the size of the corallites cannot be relied on as a specific character,
then <span class='it'>A. gracilis</span> may have to be regarded as identical with <span class='it'>A. austini</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Two specimens of corals from Beechey island are not referable to
any genus with which the writer is acquainted. In these specimens
the structure is revealed, by weathering at the calicular surface and
in horizontal and longitudinal sections, as well as in sections obtained
by rubbing down and polishing. As the writer is unable to place
this coral, to his satisfaction, in any described genus, it is thought
best to establish a new genus for its reception. The main generic
characters are enumerated below with a brief description of the
species which the writer has much pleasure in naming after Mr.
Low.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Boreaster.</span> Gen. nov.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Corallum composite, massive (or thickly incrusting), made up of
intimately connected polygonal corallites communicating with each
other by means of mural pores. Septa in the form of longitudinal
lamellæ, twelve in number. Tabulæ simple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This genus resembles <span class='it'>Favosites</span> in having numerous pores in the
walls of the corallites, but differs from it in the possession of lamellar
septa somewhat similar to those of <span class='it'>Columnaria</span>, <span class='it'>Nyctopora</span> and
<span class='it'>Lyopora</span>. From these three genera, however, <span class='it'>Boreaster</span> differs in
having 12 septa only, of two alternating sizes, to a corallite. <span class='it'>Columnaria</span>
and <span class='it'>Lyopora</span> are without mural pores. <span class='it'>Nyctopora</span> was described
by Nicholson as having pores, but in well preserved specimens from
the type locality, examined by the writer, mural pores were not seen;
it possesses 16 septa of two orders. <span class='it'>Boreaster</span> and <span class='it'>Calapœcia</span> resemble
each other in both having pores, but in the latter genus the corallites
are not intimately united under any circumstances, and the septa
are in the form of spine-bearing ridges.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This interesting coral may be conveniently grouped, with the
<span class='it'>Favositidæ</span>, as its generic affinities appear to place it close to <span class='it'>Calapœcia</span>.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Boreaster lowi.</span> Sp. nov.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Corallum growing in irregularly shaped masses with an unevenly
undulating surface; composed of small, polygonal corallites so closely
united that all trace of the line of contact between contiguous walls
is apparently lost. Corallites opening at right angles to the surface,
averaging about 75 mm. in diameter and generally five or six sided,
as seen in transverse section, the sides of the polygons being distinctly
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>
unequal. Walls of corallites thin but less so where they bound the
calyces. Septa lamallar, apparently 12 in number, of two sizes,
primary and secondary, alternating, the former stout and relatively
large, the latter rudimentary and observed with difficulty, especially
in the calyces where the six primary septa are paramountly evident,
are slightly exsert and apparently connect with the nearest and corresponding
ones of contiguous corallites. Pores relatively large, oval,
their greater diameter vertical, in a single longitudinal row between
each pair of primary septa so as to interrupt the continuity of the
secondary septa which are greatly reduced and in transverse sections
are only observed in places. Tabulæ not numerous, in the form of
simple, flat transverse diaphragms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two type specimens have a maximum length of 50 and 70

<h3><span class='it'>Favosites gothlandica</span>, Lamarck.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>There are three examples of this coral, of which two show spiniform
septa in the corallites. The smaller of the two specimens, in
which septa are seen, is preserved with a small corallum of <span class='it'>Acervularia
austini</span> in the same piece of limestone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The horizon indicated by the first and last of the above three
species of corals from Beechey island would be about that of the
Niagara formation.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>SOUTHAMPTON ISLAND, HUDSON BAY.</h2>

<h3><span class='it'>Streptelasma robustum</span>, Whiteaves.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>This large and well marked species, described originally from the
Galena-Trenton of the Lake Winnipeg region, is represented by a
number of more or less fragmentary specimens. The inner structure
is well shown in transverse and longitudinal sections.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Favosites gothlandica</span>, Lamarck.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Over forty specimens from this locality are referable to this well
known species. In many of them are seen the spiniform septa, characteristic
of all Silurian favosites, and distinguishing them from
all Devonian forms which apparently without exception possess linguiform
septa. It is possible that more than one species may be here
represented. The range in size of the corallites in <span class='it'>F. gothlandica</span> has
been noticed by the writer in his ‘Revision of the genera and species
of Canadian Palæozoic corals<a id='r1_4'/><a href='#f1_4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>*</span></sup></a>,’ 1899-1900, but in the present collection
the fragmentary condition of most of the specimens does not
admit of characters dependent on the outward form of the corallum
being used with any degree of certainty.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Syringopora verticillata</span>, Goldfuss.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>A single specimen of this species was obtained at Southampton
island. Its corallites average about 4 mm. in diameter and are rather
lax and irregular in their growth, the result of which is that the connecting
tubes are poorly developed and comparatively distant. This
particular mode of growth is admirably shown in specimens, in the
possession of the Survey, from the north end of Lake Timiskaming.

a stromatopora. This coral exhibits the structure characteristic of
the typical form of the Niagara formation, viz., moderate sized corallites,
oval in transverse section with narrow tubules intervening.
Four corallites are included in a space of 8 mm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This form also occurs in the Guelph limestone of Ontario.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A second and particularly interesting specimen was obtained
by Mr. Low at Southampton island. It differs from the typical form
in having corallites of noticeably large size, and agrees in this particular
with a specimen from the Guelph limestone at Durham, Ont.
(J. Townsend, 1884), in the museum of the Survey. The Durham
fossil has not the finer details of structure sufficiently well preserved
to show the minute tabulæ of the tubules, but in Mr. Low’s specimen
longitudinal sections of the tubules clearly reveal the highly arched,
close set tabulæ within. There are three corallites in a space of 12
mm., as in the Durham specimen, and the tubules have a width of
about ·75 mm.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Plasmopora follis</span>, M.-E. and H.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>To this species is referred a small specimen showing the inner
structure fairly well. The corallites vary in diameter from slightly
under to a little over 1 mm., and they are mostly less than their own
diameter apart with from one to three tubules, in the shortest line,
between neighbouring corallites. This species is generally considered
to be typical of the Niagara group.</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Pycnostylus elegans</span>, Whiteaves.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>A few specimens weathered so as to show only the inside of the
corallites which vary in diameter from 7 to 15 mm. An interesting
feature of these specimens is the preservation of the free edges of the
septa which are seen to be denticulated, about seven denticles occurring
in a space of 2 mm. A re-examination of the type material reveals
the presence of these denticles, although they are poorly preserved.
Mr. Low’s specimens are referable to the species from the
Guelph limestone of Ontario with large corallites (from 13 to 17
mm. in diameter) as in the other and type species from the same
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>
horizon and district, the corallites are generally smaller (from 3 to
7 mm. in diameter). As suggested by Dr. Whiteaves in his original
description, additional material with corallites of intermediate size
may prove the two forms to be specifically identical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the corals from Southampton island, <span class='it'>Streptelasma robustum</span>
indicates the presence of beds at this locality that belong to the same
horizon as those that have been assigned to the Galena-Trenton in
the Lake Winnipeg region, and similar beds exposed over a large area
to the west of Hudson bay. The beds from which the other species
from the same island are derived belong to higher horizons which are,
on the evidence of these species, of about the same geological age as
those of the Niagara and Guelph formations of Ontario.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CAPE CHIDLEY, HUDSON STRAIT.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>A single coral from this locality is represented by two fragments
that have apparently been broken from a larger mass. The exact
form of the corallum is unknown, but the structure of the corallites
is well preserved and clearly seen in longitudinal and traverse sections.
Its structural characteristics are quite different from those
of any form known to the writer, and it is regarded as representing
a new genus and species named and characterized as follows:—</p>

<h3><span class='it'>Labyrinthites.</span> Gen. nov.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Corallum massive, made up of very slender, long, columnar corallites,
upwardly directed and parallel, each one connected along the
whole of its length with two or three adjacent corallites in tortuous
series separated by narrow interspaces. Tabulæ, complete, distant.
No septa nor tubules.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the manner of growth of this coral resembles somewhat
that of <span class='it'>Halysites</span> it could scarcely be referred to that genus, on
account of the absence of septa and tubules, although in <span class='it'>Halysites
catenularia</span> var. <span class='it'>gracilis</span> tubules are apparently wanting. The small
size of the corallites would not necessarily be considered a character
sufficient to constitute generic distinction. Another genus, <span class='it'>Fletcheria</span>,
may be considered, but <span class='it'>Labyrinthites</span> has little in common with it.
In both, the tabulæ are distant and simple, practically the only point
of resemblance unless we notice the small size of the corallites of
<span class='it'>Fletcheria</span> and the stated rudimentary condition of its septa.
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As the want of septa in the Cape Chidley specimens may be due
to imperfect fossilization, <span class='it'>Labyrinthites</span> is, on account of its mode
of growth, provisionally classed with the <span class='it'>Halysitidæ</span>.</p>

<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/328_draw.jpg' alt='' id='iid-0003' style='width:60%;height:auto;'/>
<p class='caption'>X30</p>
</div>

<h3><span class='it'>Labyrinthites chidlensis.</span> Sp. nov.</h3>

<p class='pindent'>Corallum massive, composed of slender, straight, upright corallites
with numerous interspaces. Corallites a little less than ·33 mm.
in average diameter, quadrangular or five or six sides in transverse
outline, with rather thick walls. Each corallite coalesces along its
entire length with two or three adjacent ones, giving rise to a meandering
succession of tubes inclosing narrow spaces not wider than the
corallites themselves. In the specimens examined the corallites reach
a maximum length of ·30 mm. In longitudinal sections tabulæ, in the
form of thin, flat, transverse plates across the corallites, are observed,
between ·5 and 1·5 mm. apart. There are no tubules between contiguous
corallites, and the mural union appears to be complete.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Ami, who is studying the groups of fossils, other than the
corals, obtained by Mr. Low at Cape Chidley, informs me that the
majority of the Cape Chidley fossils are referable to the Ordovician,
whilst two specimens are of Silurian age. The lithological character
of the rock in which the coral is preserved appears to more nearly
approach that of the Ordovician specimens.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
